Cornell University

I’m David Skorton, president of Cornell University, (1)I was care for my professional life time in area innovation, technology transfer and higher education business 

partnership and in this moment time of innovation is so important for our city and

country. we are going to do even more what we have done so well for so long, bringing a top 10 engineering school, a top 5 faculty of computer information science, a well-tried path of starting companies, creating jobs, and expanding companies with jobs to New

York city.

Last year alone, (2)Cornell university ideas were used to study 12 companies, 12

companies in one year. (3)We want to bring that expertise, that experience, that track 

record to city they are innovated in media, in fashion, in finance. We gonna walk in to this campus just a few years from now. (4)And we gonna see hundreds of faculties and 

hundreds of graduates and professional students bring together ideas and technology and courage. And it builds think big. Can Cornell University think big for New York City? Right now, on the upper east side of New York, Cornell of in the middle, of a record

breaking, (5)***\*billion-do\*******\*llar\**** project to double the research space of world renowned well Cornell medical college.

Sometimes, circumstance brings things together in the way you could never dream of. I have been waiting for an opportunity like this for a decade and half. I had a passion and been devoted to bringing higher education and business community together for

economic development, for technology transfer, for job creation, for keeping this country moving ahead. Cornell is the natural partner for New York City.

College Admissions Test

I just got my last college application turned it. Now it’s time to cross my finger and wait.

I'm also happy that I’m officially done taking all of the admission tests for good. It started back when I was a freshman. That's when I take the PSAT (2)to help prepare for the actual SAT, starting early like that was a good way to dip my toes into the testing

world. I took it once at the beginning of my junior year, my score was pretty good.

But I knew I could do better. So I took a free SAT prep class that was offered by the school, that was a big help, because it made me really understand what to expect when I sat down in front of the test for the first time and I have friends in other towns who took prep courses at their school too.

If your school doesn’t have a course, (3)just ask your counsellor to help you find one. Since (4)your scores can impact so much like whether or not you get admitted to a college, your scholarship amount and what classes your actual take when you show up on campus,



I really wanted to take it seriously. When I took it again in the following senior year, the hard work paid off, my score went way up. So what's my advice for people? Take the SAT early and try it again if you are not satisfied, but be sure to take it seriously.

So I sent my college apps last week, finally, I'm pretty happy to be done with all the testing that you need to do actually to apply colleges, I kicked it off by checking out the

applied test deadline so I knew when I need to take the test to make sure my scores got

sent to schools on time. (5)Checked out a couple of test prep study books from the library and spent some time working over there. Just to figure out what the tests were actually  like. Then I had to decide which test to take. The SAT and ACT test are different things.

And some schools prefer one over the other. Checked with the colleges to see which test to take. After talking it over with my guidance counsellor, I decided the best thing for me to do would be to just go ahead and (6)take them both. I took them both my junior year, and I did pretty decently on each. (7)I checked out what scores were preferred by the   colleges I was aiming for and I was in that range, so felt like I was good to go.

So yeah, that was basically it, easy as a 3 pointer. Now I just need to sit back and wait for those acceptance letters to come rolling in.

It's sure, (8)I got my college applications in at the last possible second, but I did get admitted and that’s a count, right? OK, itIs ***\*not\**** what I would necessarily recommend. I

kept hearing everyone talk about how we needed to be working on applications and

taking the admissions test. (9)But I just never got my act together to do anything about it. I guess I just expected someone to come along and make me apply. It was only over the

summer that I realized that I was seriously running out of time. Once I finally started

looking into colleges and saw what test they required (10)I only had one chance left to 

take the SAT in order to get my applications in on time and be considered for admission next fall. So I did a bunch of research at the last minute and found out that there was a

test session a week later. I had to find out where the testing site was and exactly when

the test was taking place. Since it was my only way do the opportunity, I did not want to be late or show up at the wrong place. Talk about stressful. I did some last minute 

cramming with the SAT study guides. And I think that helped me prepare a little bit but I know I could turn even better if I started earlier. Putting the whole testing process often to the last minute made things a little too frantic. I will still able to get my scores and

applications in on time but if anything got wrong I would be out of options. So the bottom line is, if you think it’s too late, good news, it may not be after all. But with everything

else you got going on why put yourself in that position. The earlier you can get started, the better off you’ll be.

Language-the key to the world

This is the VOA Special English Education Report, what is the best way to learn a new language? A small study of foreign language learning in adults compared two methods.

(1, 2)One is known as the ***\*explicit\**** or classroom method. This is the kind of traditional classroom teaching where students are taught a lot of information about grammar rules. The other method is known as the implicit or immersion method. The idea here is to

learn much the way children do when they learn a native language. That is, by being with native speakers and absorbing the language that surrounds them, generally without a lot of explanation.

Teachers may combine these two methods into what Professor Michael Ullman calls immersion-style classroom teaching. But is that necessarily a better way to learn a

language?

Mr. Ullman was the senior investigator for the new study. He is a professor of

neuroscience at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington. (3)He says he was surprised to find that combining the two methods ***\*might\**** ***\*not\**** ***\*help\**** the brain in processing the new language.

MICHAEL ULLMAN: "You know, if my life were on the line, and I had to learn a

language, what would I do? I'm not sure. One possibility would be that, to start with

explicit and then go to immersion, right? Start with classroom and then go to immersion. But there is this possibility that classroom could hurt later immersion. That's what, you know, one possibility of interpreting our data."

The Public Library of Science published the study earlier this year. The (4)***\*twenty-one\**** adults in the experiment learned Brocanto2, (5)a thirteen-word language created for the study. (6)The words and grammar rules relate to a computer game similar to chess that  the learners played. For example, "Blom neimo lu neep li praz" means " … "

(7)The researchers tested the people three to ***\*six\**** ***\*months\**** after they had learned the language, to see how well they could remember it. The study found that (8)those who 

had learned it with the immersion method had brain waves similar to those of native speakers of a language when speaking that language.

Professor Ullman says those who trained with the classroom method also became more native-like in their brain processing. But only the immersion group showed full

native-like processing of the grammar. Still, he says (9)teachers should ***\*be\**** ***\*careful\**** ***\*how\**** they use the results of his study.

MICHAEL ULLMAN: "You know I would not make any curriculum changes based on  this. Nevertheless, it is suggestive, and I think it warrants further research to see whether in fact what kind of training might in fact be best not just for reaching the native brain

bases but also for, you know, maximum proficiency in different aspects of language, like grammar, you know, syntax and lexicon. So I think further research is warranted. And it

may be, for example, that (10)a combination of classroom and immersion might be best. But we don't know that."



 

Two ways to stay motivated learning a foreign language

Hi Guys, it’s me Richie from Language Dojo.com. Today I want to talk shortly about two ways to motivate yourself in language learning. (1)The biggest problem for most 

learners is that they are not motivated enough to continue learning their targeted 

language. Many people start with a language, they study it for a few weeks and then they quit, that is just a waste of time if you ask me. I have studied many languages, I have

studied Chinese I have studied Portuguese I have (2)studied French twice, I have studied Italian , I have (3)studied German I think over 3 or 4 times, and (4)I used to quit after 

about 2 to 3 weeks, that’s just a waste of time again. So how do you stay motivated

learning a language? There actually two ways I find useful to motivate myself. First way is to actually have fun during the language learning process because when you start

learning a language often or many learner often use courses or textbooks which are just boring at all, that’s not fun. (5)My favorite method for learning foreign languages is by watching television as soon as possible, I do supplement my learning or television

watching by learning vocabulary or learning some grammar points, that’s all the studying I actually do, I just watch television and that’s how I keep things fun for myself .

The second way to motivate yourself before actually learning or start to learn a

language is by seeing or doing some research about what the culture is, you don’t choose a language you choose a cultures as well, so you can switch by the run you can just first

look for the culture you like, and then choose a language that goes with the culture. If you are late back, (6)you love surfing, you love beaches, you love rainforest, I will choose

Portuguese. when you love firsts, or for example (7)if you love electronics, you can 

choose Japanese, choose culture not language and think about (8)what language do I   really want to learn to fit into the culture and my case that’s German, so those are two great ways to motivate yourself and to stay motivated throughout the language learning process you going through. So if you have more suggestions to stay motivated, drop

comments in comments section and I will see you in next video, bye.

Study Says Preventable Diseases Reduce US Life Expectancy

It used to be rare for people to live to 100. (2)But baby born in the U.S. today can 

hope to live that long. (3)In the 20th century, life expectancy in wealthy nations increased by as much as 30 years. (4)Average life expectancy for Americans is 78. But doctors are

seeing people adopt bad habits that can cut their lives short, like eating too much or eating too much junk food, exercising too little and smoking cigarettes.

(1)These habits increase the risk for cancer, diabetes, heart disease and stroke.

Researchers at Harvard University and the University of Washington wanted to find out

how many years are lost with these lifestyle choices. "What we found was that high blood pressure, smoking, overweight/obesity and high blood glucose account for five years of

loss of life expectancy in men and about four years in women at the national level," Goodarz Danaei, one of the principal researchers said.

(5)The researchers broke down the data into race, income and locale and they found even greater differences. Middle-income whites have the best blood pressure. But

(6)Asian-Americans have fewer bad habits and the best health. "They are not getting heart disease because of low blood pressure, they are not getting cancer sometimes because they have low risk factors for cancer, including smoking," Danaei said.

(7)The researchers found a 14-year difference in life expectancy between 

Asian-American and African-American men who can expect to live an average of 67  years." African-American men in the south have the lowest life expectancy, also along with African-American men living in high-risk urban areas, places like downtown Los Angeles, downtown Washington DC." Danaei explained.

African-American women are another group with low life expectancy because of

their high rates of obesity. People battling excess weight have higher rates of disability, diabetes and heart disease - disorders that make them sicker at younger ages and

dependent on medications for many years. The researchers say public health officials

could use the study to plan programs that will help people make better lifestyle choices.



How to live to be 100+

Something called the Danish Twin Study established that (1)only about 10 percent of how long the average person lives, within certain biological limits, is dictated by our 

genes. The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle. So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity.

But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula of longevity is, they

probably couldn't tell you. They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet. You have the USDA food pyramid. There is what Oprah tells us. There is what Doctor Oz tells us.

(2)The fact of the matter is there is ***\*a\**** ***\*lot of\**** ***\*confusion\**** around what really helps us 

live longer better. Should you be running marathons or doing yoga? Should you eat

organic meats or should you be eating tofu? When it comes to supplements, should you

be taking them? How about these hormones or resveratrol? And does purpose play into it? Spirituality? And how about how we socialize? Well, our approach to finding longevity

was to (4)team up with National Geographic, and the National institute on Aging, to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined. And bring a  team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do, to 

distill down the cross-cultural distillation.

So what are the common denominators in these three cultures? What are the things that they all do? And we manage to boil it down to nine. In fact we've done two more

Blue Zone expeditions since this and these common denominators hold true. And the first one, and I'm about to utter a heresy here, none of them exercise. Instead, they set up

their lives so that they are (5)constantly nudged into physical activity. These 100-year-old Okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor, 30 or 40 times a day. Sardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs. Every trip to the

store, or to church or to a friend's house occasions a walk. They don't have any

conveniences. There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work. If they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand.

That's physical activity. That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill

does. When they do intentional physical activity, it's the things they enjoy. They tend to

walk, the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline, and they all tend to have a

garden. They know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook. Each of these cultures take time to downshift. The Sardinians pray. The Seventh-Day

Adventists pray. The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration. But when you're in a hurry or stressed out, that triggers something called the inflammatory response, which is

associated with everything from Alzheimer's disease to cardiovascular disease.

(6)When you slow down for 15 minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti-inflammatory state. They have vocabulary for sense of purpose, ikigai, like the



 

Okinawans. You know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born, because of infant mortality, and the year you retire. These people know their sense of

purpose, and they activate in their life, (7)that's worth about seven years of extra life 

expectancy. (8)There's no longevity diet. Instead, these people drink a little bit every day, not a hard sell to the American population. They tend to eat a plant-based diet. Doesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts. And they have strategies to keep

from overeating, little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time. And then the foundation of all this is how they connect. They put their families first, take care of their children and their aging parents. (9)They all tend to belong to a faith-based 

community, which is worth between four and 14 extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month.

And the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe. They were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people. We know from the Framingham studies, that if your three best friends are obese there is a 50

percent better chance that you'll be overweight.

(10)So, if you hang out with unhealthy people, that's going to have a measurable 

impact over time. Instead, if your friend's idea of recreation is physical activity, bowling, or playing hockey, biking or gardening, if your friends drink a little, but not too much, and they eat right, and they're engaged, and they're trusting and trustworthy, that is going to have the biggest impact over time. Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world  has ever worked for more than two percent of the population.

Exercise programs usually start in January; they're usually done by October. When it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else. But when you think about it, your friends are long-term adventures, and therefore, perhaps the most

significant thing you can do to add more years to your life, and life to your years. Thank you very much.



More than (1) 2.3 million couples get married in United States every year.

Sometimes a couples may (2) simply go to a courthouse or city hall and be married by a judge or other (3) official. But more elaborate wedding ceremonies are big business,

adding (4) $70 billion dollars to the American economy every year.

Weddings also often require couples to (5) plan ahead. Big Decaro was married in 2003, (6)13 months after her future husband asked her to marry him.

“You know, we thought we wanted at least a year to just plan and not feel rushed. And we thought that was just (8) a choice we were going to make because that's what we wanted. But it (9) turns out when we started calling around, a lot of the venues were

already (10)booked.”

The difficulty of finding a place or venue is not a surprise to Susan Smith with a 

professional wedding planner. “In general, most brides want to get married on a Saturday night. So that is a limited date. And again, it goes back to they want the venue. Then, they will have to wait until available or change the date. Also the process makes longer than

what people think. “

Susan Smith says weddings often also cost more than people expect. “It’s very easy to get carried away. I mean in the ways the website and television shows are all about 

weddings. It's easy to see things that you can’t afford and then you want them. And then, it’s easy to run over the budget.”

M.Z. Hemingway wrote in the wall street journal newspaper in 2007. Then she went a wedding expo five months before her wedding. An expo is an event where couples can look at every type of business selling anything connected to weddings. She discovered

that business is offering the best flowers, cakes, and wedding photos all already

scheduled for the day she wanted. She wrote that the average cost of a wedding in the United States was almost 28,000 dollars. About the same, as many cars she called it a  new level of excess. More than half the money is to spend to rent a place to have the wedding and pay for dinner for all the guests.

Traditionally, the parents of the bride pay for the wedding. But today, the cost of the wedding is more often a shared expense. The bride and groom are often older and may pay some of the cost themselves. Says the wedding planner Susan Smith, “That is the

older bride and I don't necessarily mean old, but 27 or 30. Then. They're already

established in their own careers. And they have money of their own. So, they are able to pay for it. “

Big Decaro says her wedding cost more than she expected. But she is not sorry for

the money that was spent. “We loved it, we loved the wedding, everything went very well and. It was just that the day was so fast. It just went by just like that and we really didn't  think about the money so much.”



 

***\*Section\**** ***\*B: Task 2\****

 

Wow...our crazy and funny wedding traditions

There are so many traditions taking about the weddings, and so we decided to talk about the history of weddings with Robbin and you got some interesting things on the table.

Seed was considered a life giving seed. So when the couple would exit from the ceremony, is still quite as frequent to see that. (2)It represents have many children.

(4)Jewelry or stones represents a man wanted to marry a woman, and he basically had to buy her. And you would give precious stones.

Honey. Where does honey come from while you hear the word honeymoon back

hundreds of years ago when a man decided it was time to take a bride. He would find

whoever it was and he would steal her, basically, and his friends would collaborate with him and he would go to a secret place. And for roughly 30 days, or all the phases of the moon. He would have her and they would have a brew with type of drink that had honey in it, so because of the moon and the phases and the honey we came up with, the name came honeymoon.

An interesting one is why is the ring on that finger? There's two different reasons.

The Egyptians believed that (5)there was a vein that went from this finger to your heart. That meant that it was a direct line of love. The love was everlasting now. Going back a  few hundred years in Europe, they believed that the man, the groom, would take the ring put a partly on the thumb, take it off, and put it partly on the index finger. Put a partly on the middle finger, then on this finger, and those first three fingers were at the father, son and the holy spirit.

What about the bridal shower? This is what kind of where the parasol comes in play if a father was against his daughter marrying a certain man. (6)The town was throw an   event or gifts to the bride. Goes back to 1890, they would have a party for the bride to be and they put gifts underneath of Parasol. Thus showering the bride with gifts.

Going back a few hundred years ago, (8)bathing was considered a luxury. So we bribe would often hold flowers. (7)That would help cover the stench.

Often when a man thought was time to take a bride again, he would find whoever  that bride was to be he would steal her, basically. And he would invite his best man came in, usually the strongest man. When he was taking that woman, he would have the best man and they'd have sores to fight off the family and friends so that they could come

back and get her. He would find a secluded place the best man would stand guard with a sword at the door. And would stay there until basically, as tradition says, till she became pregnant. During the ceremony he would hold her hand with his left hand and the right hand he would be ready to fight.



 

Keep your goal to yourself

Everyone,  please  think  of  your  biggest personal goal. For real -- you can  take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it. Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay? Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it. Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do. (1)Imagine their congratulations, and their high image of you. Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud? Don't you feel one step closer already, like it's already becoming part of your identity?

Well, bad news: you should have kept your mouth shut, because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it. (2)The repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. Any time you have a goal, there are some steps that  need to  be  done,  some  work that  needs  to  be  done  in  order  to achieve it. (3)Ideally you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work. (4)But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it, psychologists have found that it's called a "social reality." (5)The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done.

(6)And then because you've felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary.

So this goes against conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals, right? So they hold us to it.

So, let's look at the proof. (7)1926: Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology, called this "substitution." (8)1933: Wera Mahler found when it was acknowledged by others, it felt  real in the  mind. (9)1982,  Peter  Gollwitzer wrote a whole  book about this, and in 2009, he did some new tests that were published.

It goes like this: 163 people across four separate tests. Everyone wrote down their personal goal. Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room, and half didn't. Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal, but they were told that they could stop at any time. Now, those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal. But those who  had announced  it quit  after only 33  minutes, on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal.

So  if  this  is  true,  what  can  we  do?  Well,  (10)you  could resist  the  temptation  to announce  your  goal.  You  can  delay  the gratification that the social acknowledgment brings, and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing. But if you  do  need to talk about something, you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction, such as, "I really want to run this marathon, so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don't, okay?"

So audience, next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal, what will you say? Exactly! Well done.



A few years ago, I felt like I was stuck in a rut, so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher, Morgan Spurlock, and (1) try something new for 30 days. The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days. (2) It turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life.

There's a few things  I learned while doing these 30-day challenges. The first was, instead of the months flying by, forgotten, the time was much more memorable. This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month. And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day. I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges, (3)my  self-confidence  grew.  (4)I  ***\*went\**** ***\*from\****  desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work. For fun!

Even last year, I ended up hiking up Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges.

I  also  figured  out  that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for 30 days. Have you ever wanted to write a novel? Every November, tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel, from scratch, in 30 days. It turns out, (6)all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month. So I did. By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until you've written your words for the day. You might be sleep-deprived, but you'll finish your novel. Now is my book the next great American novel? No. (5)I wrote it in a month. It's awful.

But for the rest of my life, if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party, I don't have to say, "I'm a computer scientist." No, no, if I want to, I can say, "I'm a novelist."

So here's one last thing I'd like to mention. (7)  I learned that when  I made small, sustainable changes, things  I could  keep  doing, they were  more  likely to  stick. There's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges. In fact, they're a ton of fun. (8) But they're less likely to stick. When I gave up sugar for 30 days, day 31 looked like this.

So here's my question to you: What are you waiting for? I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not, so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot! For the next 30 days.

Thanks.



 

Women and Jobs

(1) “Men are finished.” That was the proposition in a debate at New York University (NYU) on September 20th. Hardly, a world bank report published the day before finds that, although  particular  groups  of ill-educated young men are doing badly, and although women’s  lives  have  improved  a lot in the past 20 year, sexual in equality at work is remarkable stubborn. Globally, women earn 10-30% (ten to thirty percentage) less than men. They are also concentrated in “women’s” jobs. Annoyingly, economic growth does not seem to narrow the gap.

This  is  surprising.  You might expect that as countries get richer, women would become better educated and jobs requiring brute strength would become less important. Rich countries also have larger public sectors, where the wage gap is smaller. Yet overall, the gap is no smaller in rich countries such as Britain and the Netherlands than in poor ones such as the Philippines.  More striking, there is  little sign that women are moving into  traditionally  male occupations.  Mean  utterly dominate such beefy industries as transport and mining. A hefty 11% of men work in constructions: only 1% of women do.

(2)Women  cluster  in  communications, retail and public administration, including education and health. (3)This is true regardless of national income. Looking at Bangladesh, Mexico and Sweden, the  bank  found that  men  and  women tended to separate themselves into the same sorts of occupation in all three countries. (Bangladeshi shops and hotels, which employed disproportionately more men, were exceptions.)

What explains all this? The World Bank suggests three reasons. First, discrimination. Some  men  think  women  are  less  capable,  and some laws  treat  the sexes differently.

(4)Women also have ***\*fewer\**** assets that can be turned into capital. Land is a prime example. In  16  poor  countries,  55%  of  female-headed  households  own  land,  but  64%  of male-headed ones  do.  Female  plots  are  usually  smaller,  too.  This  makes  it  harder  for women to start  businesses.  In China, South Africa and Senegal, the  bank found, (5)food-processing firms prefer to sign export contracts with men, since they fear women will find it harder to meet the terms of the contract. So women do not grow cash crops. This problem is not confined to poor countries: (6)the European Union found women less likely to start a business than men, largely for lack of credit.

Next, women are sometimes less qualified than men. (7)Though advances in female education are widespread, they are ***\*not\**** universal. Among older workers, men tend to

have spent longer studying. Also, in the few countries with statistics on the matter,

(8)***\*male\**** workers tend to have been employed for longer than women, giving them more work experience.

But (9)the main reason that women cluster in low-paid fields, the bank argues, is that they do not control their own time.

(10)In rich Austria and Italy, women do at least three times as much housework and 



 

child care as men. In poorer Cambodia, they do 50% more. Income has little to do with this. Pakistani men allocate the same amount of time to paid work, housework and child care as Swedish men. Everywhere, this constrains women’s job choices.

Gender Inequality

More young women go to school than ever before. That's good for the girls and the economy. Every extra year of education leads to an average increase of around 9% in GDP per capita. (2)In OECD countries, 15 year old girls read at a full school year higher than  boys. At university level in 2009, nearly 60% of graduates in the OECD area were female.

If that trend continues, (3)by 2025, it will be closer to 70%. And the Czech Republic,

Iceland, Norway, Slovak Republic and Sweden that could be almost twice as many female students as male in higher education. But women and men are still choosing different

study and career paths. (3)More than 70% of university students in education and 75% of (4)***\*health and social science\**** graduates are women. While some 70% of engineering, 

manufacturing and construction graduates are men. Better education means more

women work. But many countries are facing (5)the double challenge of an aging 

population and falling fertility rate. The challenge is (6)ensuring that more women work and those who want to can go full time, that would requires better child care and more flexible work conditions.

And those pay-slips are smaller for women than for men, on average, (7)16% smaller, and comprise 21% among top wage earners. Discussing extends to the boardroom on

average across listed companies in OECD, (8)there's only one woman for every nine men 

at the boardroom table. In Norway, 40% of board members are women, as a result of a

mandatory quota introduced in 2006. In Sweden, France and Finland, between 15 and 20% of board members are women. (9)That drops to less than 5% in Germany, Japan and the 

Netherlands.

Education is a good start, but what about employment and entrepreneurship?

(10)The next step must break down the barriers in the job market, giving men and

women the same chance to contribute both at home and work with boost growth and wellbeing for everyone.

British and American Families

(1)British and American families are small. In fact, the populations of both Britain and USA have (2)stopped growing. The typical family has (3)a father, mother and 2   

children. Grandparents come to visit but do not usually live with their children. (4)Most people get married between the ages of 20 and 25. But (5)***\*many\**** ***\*of\**** marriages end in 

divorce. This means that in both countries there are large number of single-parent

families: one father or one mother looking after their children alone. The typical (6)British family has a car, a color TV set, a washing machine and a cat or dog as well. They start the day at 7 o,clock, have breakfast at 8 and off to work by 8:30. (7)Most women now go out to work as well as men. The children have lunch at school at about 12:30 and come home at 4 in the afternoon. Their parents are usually be home by 6 o,clock and the family eat

together. (8)After the dinner, the father may go to the pub for drink or stay at home and watch TV with others. (9)Children go to bed early at about 8 o,clock, 2 or 3 hours before their parents. The typical American family had more money than a British family. Many  have2 or 3 cars, large modern kitchens and more electric goods. They eat more meat and spend more on cloth. (10)But their daily program is nearly the same. Like British children, American children eat lunch at school, come home mid-afternoon and go to bed early

than their parents.

husband Bill.

When Jane was at home all day, she was able to clean the house, go grocery

shopping, wash the clothes,  ⑧take care of the children and cook two or three meals

each day. She was very busy, of course, but she succeeded in ⑨getting everything done. Now these same things need to be done, but Jane has only evenings and early mornings to do them. Both Jane and Bill are tired when they arrived at home at 6 p.m. Bill ⑩is 

accustomed to sitting down and reading the paper or watching TV until dinner is ready.

This is exactly what Jane  ⑾feels like doing, but someone has to fix dinner, and Bill

expects it to be Jane. Jane is becoming very angry at Bill's attitude. She feels that they

should share the household jobs. But Bill feels that everything should be ⑿the same as it was before Jane went back to work.

Ranchers’ Lives

American out west to me is freedom. Freedom to make your own choices and live  the life you want to live. We are the Hampton family. (1)We have been on this land for  over 100 years and we are 4 generations ranchers. We have cattle, horses and sheep and a lot of hard work. (2)But we have the special connection with our land, our animals and our community. Sam Hampton: I’m a cow boy and a part-time sheep herder.

Steve Hampton: I’m a cow boy.

Janna Hampton: I’m a cow girl.

Dan Hampton: I’m proud to be a cow boy.

Sam Hampton: And out  ……（没听全）ing is the way we loved. I use the light to get up to (3)feed the horses first so they can have the energy to move out so they can go on most of the day. After I feed the horses, I hand our breakfast. Then we put saddles on the horses to get ready to go out to hail cattle.

Janna Hampton: It’s not like in the movies where everybody is loping around on their horses. (4)I mean everything is so fast on the pace.

Sam Hampton: It takes about a day to move the cows from one pasture to another.

Dan Hampton: It is to …（没听全）the range (5)to know how many livestock to put in without over-grazing. We use horses to herd them to start moving them in the direction wherever you want to go. (6)We raise about 6 hundred tons of hay. (7)We have about a  quarter-million pounds of beef that we sell.

Sam Hampton: I really enjoy teaching the younger the lesson of how to trail the cattle.

Janna Hampton: There are so many different jobs on the ranchers which is hard to

summarize. Steve Hampton: We all have our own chores … .（没听全）(8)help other with their irrigating, the mechanical work, fixing fences. Everything has to be done.

Steve Hampton: Rancher…so we have many hats.

Sam Hampton: (9)You don’t real l y have to look. Once you step outside. It’s there.

Steve Hampton: I’m enjoy being outdoors and you know every day is different.

Janna Hampton: Why do I choose here? It’s a connection of love of this land and this area.

Sam Hampton: (10)Our life is rather simple but it earns rewarding.

Janna Hampton: We get a tremendous feeling of this satisfaction from the work here we do every day.

Steve Hampton: I think nothing can beat the values of hard work and just being out in the fresh air.

Janna Hampton: You’re making a difference in your family’s life.

Sam Hampton: I think raising the children on this ranch and with livestock and the great outdoors has been a real real benefit to our life.
