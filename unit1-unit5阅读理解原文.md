1. Think of examples from your own life to show the payoff for you in communication if you learn English really well.
2. What are some of the specific techniques you are aware of for communicating clearly with people at work?
3. Mark Twain, an American author, said, "It usually takes me more than three weeks to prepare a good impromptu speech." How long will it take you to prepare an oral presentation? And what will you do to prepare for it?

 

①　The ability to communicate well is one of the biggest factors in business success. You could be an excellent designer, but if you're unable to promote your services and communicate effectively with clients and colleagues, your potential is limited. The principal areas where communication is essential include:

②　When you freelance or own a business, your livelihood depends on your ability to sell your services. You need to be able to convince prospects that you are the best person for the job, and the communication secrets in this article will help you do this successfully.

 

 

**1.** **Ask the Right** **Questions**

③　Part of selling your services is being able to understand the client's unique needs. You can do this only by asking questions that get to the heart of the challenges they are facing. Once you have a clear understanding of the problem to solve, you can pitch

your services as the best possible option for the client, outlining how you will meet their needs.

**2.** **Communicate** **Professionally**

④　Your professionalism can win you contracts, and your communication skills add to the complete package. Take time to proofread all e-mails prior to sending; use a business e-mail address with a proper signature; answer the phone professionally; and speak articulately and competently at all times.

**3.** **Schedule** **and** **Prepare** **Thoroughly**

⑤　We're all busy these days, so scheduling your meetings in advance ensures that you and your clients have an adequate amount of uninterrupted time to speak. Once your meeting is scheduled, take time to prepare an agenda that outlines focus points and sets a structure. Sharing the agenda for the meeting gives both you and the client an opportunity to fully prepare.

**4.** **Speak, Pause,** **Listen**

⑥　When you have several topics to tackle, rushing through them to get all of your ideas out may be tempting. But this causes confusion and makes the client feel that their input is not important. Slow down, and remember that communication is a two-way street. Establish a give-and-take that allows both parties to have their say.

**5.** **Follow up in** **Writing**

⑦　While you may be taking notes during phone or in-person meetings, the other party might not be, so follow up after the meeting with a written message, giving an overview of the discussion to make sure you are both on the same page. Summarize what was agreed, repeat questions that were raised and outline the next steps and responsibilities for both parties.

**6.** **Ask for** **Feedback**

⑧　One way to maintain long-term relationships with your clients is by keeping open lines of communication. This can be accomplished by asking them for their input on how they feel about the service, at the end of a project, during day-to-day conversations or through formal surveys. The format matters less than the actual act of it, so work it into your business and fine tune as you go along. When conducting surveys, use an online service that tracks responses for you. There are several online services that should give you enough functionality to conduct client surveys. Here are a few worth checking out:

![img](file:///C:\Users\yunqi\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml1588\wps9.png) SurveyMonkey

![img](file:///C:\Users\yunqi\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml1588\wps10.png) Zoomerang

 

**7.** **Address** **Problems**

⑨　If a client is unhappy, don't ignore their complaints. Ask them why they are unhappy and what you can do to fix the situation. The longer you wait to bring it up, the worse it will get. Addressing the issue and being accountable when appropriate puts you on the path to resolution. And your willingness to face the problem head-on tells the client that you care about the project and their satisfaction. If a client complains about your turnaround time or responsiveness, you may need to create a more formal project plan to clarify expectations. A working document like this can also eliminate some of the uncertainty regarding responsibilities and keep everyone on track.

**8.** **Try** **a** **New** **Format**

⑩　If a problem with your client stems from miscommunication, try a different method of communication. If you have been handling everything via e-mail, schedule a phone call to see if that clears things up. After the call, you can summarize the conversation in an e-mail to the client, which will give you another opportunity to get both of you on the same page again. 

⑪　A rule of thumb is to limit your e-mail to one screen-full (i.e. above the fold); anything that requires more space than that should be handled by phone. This should help you avoid some of the pitfalls of relying on e-mail alone.

⑫　Networking events, conferences and other face-to-face opportunities can take your business to a new level. These tips focus on helping you get the most from in-person networking activities.

**9.** **Communicate** **Confidently**

⑬　Be confident and use body language to support that confidence. Shake hands firmly, smile and make eye contact while communicating at live networking events. Don't forget to bring business cards to hand out to everyone you meet, and remember to relax and be yourself. Before heading out to a networking event, practice introducing yourself to new people to gain confidence. Working on your introduction with someone you trust and asking for their feedback also helps.

**10.** **Prepare** **an** **Elevator** **Speech**

⑭　An elevator speech helps you make the most of a first impression, while making networking situations easier and more productive. Be prepared with your speech and ready to answer common questions about your business and what you do. Practice your elevator speech ahead of time so that you are relaxed and comfortable with introducing yourself. 

⑮　Your elevator speech should last no longer than 30 seconds and should convey how your product or service solves a problem for your target audience. An elevator speech could go something like:

⑯　Have you ever gotten completely lost on a website because the navigation was inconsistent, confusing and disorganized? What I do is redesign websites for small-business owners who need a stronger, more coherent online presence. By learning as much as I can about the company, I create a strategic plan for reinventing an existing website to be more functional and user-friendly.

⑰　Whether you market your business online, in person or through traditional advertising, communication is key to brand awareness. Here are two secrets to magnify the impact of your marketing across the board.

**11.** **Be** **Responsive**

⑱　A big part of marketing is being available to your target audience and following up when necessary. If you market your business through social media outlets including Twitter, Facebook and blogging watch for and respond to comments, questions and especially complaints. And when you are contacted as a result of offline marketing activities, respond quickly and professionally. 

⑲　Plenty of recent examples on Twitter show how certain brands have been slow to respond to criticism, hoping it would die down, only to see it spin out of control. Also, when you do respond on social media websites, keep it professional, and avoid confrontation because that would only spread the fire.

**12.** **Write** **Well**

⑳　You can't successfully promote your business if your marketing copy is not clear, concise and action-provoking. If writing is not your forte, consider hiring someone to help you craft copy that attracts potential clients, generates interest in your services and motivates potential clients to action. To strengthen your writing skills, start a swipe files of marketing copy that you like and have found inspirational. Read through it and make notes of what you like in particular and what pulls you in. By making this a frequent exercise, you should be able to learn what makes good copy good.

21　Being a tolerable communicator and an effective communicator is the difference between being good and great at what you do. If your design skills are not up to par with your competitors', then strong communication skills can put you ahead. Strengthening your communication skills is worth the time and effort, and you may be

surprised by how much you benefit from more polished and professional interaction.

22　What do you think? What impact has communication had on your success? How have you improved your ability to communicate with clients and colleagues?

 

***\*Unit2\****

***\*The art of negotiating\****

1. Negotiating is critical to your business success. Poor negotiation can cripple a company just as quickly as losing key customers. While most negotiating strategies seem like common sense, it's not uncommon for people to get caught up in the emotion of the moment and ignore their basic instincts.Emotion, luck and magic have no place in a successful negotiation. It takes an iron gut, homework, street smarts and unblinking discipline. These keys will unlock your ability to get the best deal possible under any circumstances.

***\*Preparation Is Key\****

2. Know about the party you're negotiating with so you can capitalize on your strengths and the party's weaknesses. If the other party is very experienced, that means he also has a history that could contain useful information. If possible, talk to business associates who have dealt with this person before. Many negotiators develop patterns and certain styles that you may be able to use to your advantage.
3. If you are a buyer, make sure you are thoroughly familiar with the product or service that will be the subject of the negotiation. If the other party senses you are weak on such details, you may be a prime target for a bluff or another technique designed to create anxiety and uncertainty.Psychology plays a crucial role in your ability to make the most of the other party's lack of preparation and anticipate their next move.
4. Most negotiators have a price target or goal in mind before they start. It should be based on realistic expectations considering all the constraints including budget limits, direction from management, pressure to make sales goals, and a myriad of other external forces.During the course of the negotiation, the goal may change based on changes in scope and other unforeseen actions by either party. While your ultimate goal should be realistic, this should not constrain your first offer or counteroffer.
5. There are basic principles that apply to every negotiation. The first offer is usually the most important and the benchmark by which all subsequent offers will be judged and compared. You'll never get what you don't ask for, so make your first offer bold and aggressive.The asking price will typically include a margin to give away during negotiations. You want to take all of that and hopefully more, so start lower than the seller expects. Don't worry about insulting the other party. As long as your offer is not ridiculous, the other side will continue the negotiations in hopes of settling at a better number.

***\*Have a Strategy\****

6. As a buyer, do not disclose your budget or other limitations in your negotiating position. A favorite ploy of salesmen is to reshuffle the product specifications, schedule and other parameters in order to sell you an inferior product to fit your budget. You want the best product you can get for the money you have to spend, so employ an approach that maintains the possibility of spending less than you had originally planned.
7. Always have something to give away without hurting your negotiating position. If you're submitting a price proposal to a buyer, consider inserting decoys and red herrings for the other party to find. For example, if you are bidding a project, consider including some nice-to-have items that aren't critical to the success of the project. You could also include spare parts that may or may not be needed in the end. If the buyer takes those items out to reduce the overall cost, you haven't lost anything but it may help the buyer reach his price target.Such distractions will help to divert the other party from attacking the meat of your proposal. Employing this strategy must be viewed in the context and in consideration of what other bidders may be doing. If you know that the only way to win the bid is to provide a barebones cost, then this strategy may not be appropriate.
8. Watch for clues such as body movement, speech patterns and reactions to what you say.Be prepared to suspend or cancel negotiations if you feel things are getting nowhere or the other party seems stuck in their position. Indicate your reluctance to continue under those conditions and make the other side wonder if you are ever coming back.
9. From a contractual standpoint, a counteroffer automatically rejects all previous offers. If your offer is rejected and you are asked to submit a new and better offer, do not fall into that trap. That would be equal to negotiating with yourself, and you should never do this. If the last offer on the table is yours, always insist on a counteroffer to force the other party to move his/her position before you make another offer.

***\*Find the Leverage\****

10. In addition to exploiting the other party's weaknesses, concentrate on taking maximum advantage of your strengths. If you're the only source available for a particular product, you have tremendous leverage across the board. If economic conditions have created a market in which the product you're selling is in great demand and low supply, that gives you more bargaining power to name your price. If you are the buyer in a depressed economy, you normally have the advantage of too much supply and lower demand.

***\*The Offer\****

11. An offer must encompass all of the elements of the bargain and will normally comprise the basis for a contract that formalizes the agreement. If you make an offer without nailing down all of the specifics, you may find out later that there was no meeting of the minds with the other party. The basis of the bargain should include: offer price (in proper denomination), statement of work (scope), identification and quantities of goods or services, delivery schedule, performance incentives (if any), express warranties (if any), terms and conditions, and any documents incorporated by reference.
12. Trading one element for another such as a lower price for a more relaxed schedule is a common tactic. These bargaining chips should be kept in your hip pocket until you need them to close the deal and get the price you want. While your primary focus is normally on price, you should always keep all the other components of the deal in the forefront of your mind.Don't be pressured into accepting boilerplate contracts represented as the "standard of the industry" or something that "we always use." Everything, including the fine print, is open to change. If the other party refuses to alter onerous terms, consider taking your business elsewhere.
13. To avoid misunderstandings, offers should be presented in writing and include all elements of the bargain. It's a good idea to keep notes containing the rationale for each offer.Should things go awry, you need to restart negotiations. Part of the process is benefiting from lessons learned and refining your approach and technique. If you work for a company or the government, those notes are usually required to document the negotiated outcome and complete the contract file.

***\*Go for a Win-Win Solution\****

14. Throughout the negotiation, try to determine what you believe to be an acceptable outcome for the other party. It may be a combination of different things that aren't necessarily tied solely to price. For example, the delivery date may be the most important thing to the other party, while product quality may be your primary driver.
15. Understanding the other side's priorities is just as important as understanding your own, so figure out what you would do if you were in his shoes. When constructing your offers, attempt to satisfy some of his priorities if doing so doesn't weaken your overall position. Be prepared to give up the little things in exchange for the big things you don't want to concede.Know your limits and how far you're willing to go on all aspects of the deal. 
16. While you have the power to influence the negotiation process in your favor, your goal should be to secure a good deal without extracting the last pound of flesh from the other party. This is especially true if you will be negotiating with the same party on a recurring basis.
17. Once the negotiation is completed, you want to be able to work effectively with those in the other party during contract performance. If they are threatened and pounded into submission, they probably won't negotiate with you again, possibly cutting off any future business. While heated confrontation is a common occurrence during negotiations, at some point collaboration and compromise are needed to get a deal.

***\*Closing the Deal\****

18. Successful negotiation is like horse-trading in that it requires a sense of timing, creativity, keen awareness and the ability to anticipate the other party's next move. Negotiation is also like chess in that each move should be designed to set up not only your next move, but several moves down the line. Generally, your moves should get progressively smaller, and you can expect the same from the other party.

### ***\*Text A: Mergers and Acquisitions: Understanding Takeovers\****

1. Terms like "dawn raid," "poison pill," and "shark repellent" might seem like they belong in James Bond movies, but there's nothing fictional about them—they are part of the world of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Owning stock in a company means you are part owner, and as we see more and more sector-wide consolidation, mergers and acquisitions are the resultant proceedings. So it is important to know what these terms mean for your holdings. 
2. Mergers, acquisitions and takeovers have been a part of the business world for centuries. In today's dynamic economic environment, companies are often faced with decisions concerning these actions—after all, the job of management is to maximize shareholder value. Through mergers and acquisitions, a company can (at least in theory) develop a competitive advantage and ultimately increase shareholder value. 
3. There are several ways that two or more companies can combine their efforts. They can partner on a project, mutually agree to join forces and merge, or one company can outright acquire another company, taking over all its operations, including its holdings and debt, and sometimes replacing management with their own representatives. It's this last case of dramatic unfriendly takeovers that is the source of much of M&A's colorful vocabulary. 

***\*Hostile takeover\****

4. This is an unfriendly takeover attempt by a company or raider that is strongly resisted by the management and the board of directors of the target firm. These types of takeovers are usually bad news, affecting employee morale at the target firm, which can quickly turn to animosity against the acquiring firm. Grumblings like, “Did you hear they are axing a few dozen people in our finance department...” can be heard by the water cooler. While there are examples of hostile takeovers working, they are generally tougher to pull off than a friendly merger.

***\*Dawn Raid\****

5. This is a corporate action more common in the United Kingdom; however, it has also occurred in the United States. During a dawn raid, a firm or investor aims to buy a substantial holding in the takeover-target company's equity by instructing brokers to buy the shares as soon as the stock markets open. By getting the brokers to conduct the buying of shares in the target company (the "victim"), the acquirer (the "predator") masks its identity and thus its intent.
6. The acquirer then builds up a substantial stake in its target at the current stock market price. Because this is done early in the morning, the target firm usually doesn't get informed about the purchases until it is too late, and the acquirer now has controlling interest. In the U.K., there are now restrictions on this practice. 

***\*Saturday night special\****

7. A Saturday night special is a sudden attempt by one company to take over another by making a public tender offer. The name comes from the fact that these maneuvers used to be done over the weekends. This too has been restricted by the Williams Act in the US, whereby acquisitions of 5% or more of equity must be disclosed to the Securities Exchange Commission . 
8. Takeovers are announced practically every day, but announcing them doesn't necessarily mean everything will go ahead as planned. In many cases the target company does not want to be taken over. What does this mean for investors? Everything! There are many strategies that management can use during M&A activity, and almost all of these strategies are aimed at affecting the value of the target's stock in some way. Let's take a look at some more popular ways that companies can protect themselves from a predator. These are all types of what is referred to as "shark repellent." 
9. A golden parachute measure discourages an unwanted takeover by offering lucrative benefits to the current top executives, who may lose their job if their company is taken over by another firm. Benefits written into the executives' contracts include items such as stock options, bonuses, liberal severance pay and so on. Golden parachutes can be worth millions of dollars and can cost the acquiring firm a lot of money and therefore act as a strong deterrent to proceeding with their takeover bid. 
10. A spin-off of the term "blackmail," greenmail occurs when a large block of stock is held by an unfriendly company or raider, who then forces the target company to repurchase the stock at a substantial premium to destroy any takeover attempt. This is also known as a "bon voyage bonus" or a "goodbye kiss." 
11. This is a tactic by which the target company issues a large number of bonds that come with the guarantee that they will be redeemed at a higher price if the company is taken over. Why is it called macaroni defense? Because if a company is in danger, the redemption price of the bonds expands, kind of like macaroni in a pot! This is a highly useful tactic, but the target company must be careful that it doesn't issue so much debt that it cannot make the interest payments. 
12. Takeover-target companies can also use leveraged recapitalization to make themselves less attractive to the bidding firm. 
13. Here, management threatens that in the event of a takeover, the management team will resign at the same time en masse. This is especially useful if they are a good management team; losing them could seriously harm the company and make the bidder think twice. On the other hand, hostile takeovers often result in the management being fired anyway, so the effectiveness of a people pill defense really depends on the situation. 
14. With this strategy, the target company aims at making its own stock less attractive to the acquirer. There are two types of poison pills. The "flip-in" poison pill allows existing shareholders (except the bidding company) to buy more shares at a discount. This type of poison pill is usually written into the company's shareholder-rights plan. The goal of the "flip-in" poison pill is to dilute the shares held by the bidder and make the takeover bid more difficult and expensive. 
15. The "flip-over" poison pill allows stockholders to buy the acquirer's shares at a discounted price in the event of a merger. If investors fail to take part in the poison pill by purchasing stock at the discounted price, the outstanding shares will not be diluted enough to ward off a takeover. 
16. An extreme version of the poison pill is the "suicide pill" whereby the takeover-target company may take action that may lead to its ultimate destruction. 
17. With the sandbag tactic the target company stalls with the hope that another, more favorable company (like "a white knight") will make a takeover attempt. If management sandbags too long, however, they may be getting distracted from their responsibilities of running the company. 
18. A white knight is a company (the "good guy") that gallops in to make a friendly takeover offer to a target company that is facing a hostile takeover from another party (a "black knight"). The white knight offers the target firm a way out with a friendly takeover. 
19. The next time you read a news release that says that your company is using a poison pill to ward off a takeover attempt, you'll now know what it means. More importantly, you'll know that you have the opportunity to purchase more shares at a cheap price. M&A has an entire vocabulary of its own, expressed through some of the rather creative strategies employed in the process, such as the ones we've touched on above. Hopefully by reading this article you are at least a bit wiser in the wacky world of M&A terminology. By understanding what is happening to your holdings during a takeover or attempted takeover, you may one day even save money.

## **Text A: Accounting Explained with Brief History and Modern Job Requirements**

**1.** Accounting is the process of recording financial transactions pertaining to a business. The accounting process includes summarizing, analyzing, and reporting these transactions to oversight agencies, regulators, and tax collection entities. The financial statements used in accounting are a concise summary of financial transactions over an accounting period, summarizing a company’s operations, financial position, and cash flows.

**2.** Accounting is one of the key functions of almost any business. It may be handled by a bookkeeper or an accountant at a small firm, or by sizable finance departments with dozens of employees at larger companies. The reports generated by various streams of accounting, such as cost accounting and managerial accounting, are invaluable in helping management make informed business decisions.

**3.** The financial statements that summarize a large company’s operations, financial position, and cash flows over a particular period are concise and consolidated reports based on thousands of individual financial transactions. As a result, all professional accounting designations are the culmination of years of study and rigorous examinations combined with a minimum number of years of practical accounting experience.

**4.** The history of accounting has been around almost as long as money itself. Accounting history dates back to ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Babylon. For example, during the Roman Empire, the government had detailed records of its finances. However, modern accounting as a profession has only been around since the early 19th century.

**5.** Luca Pacioli is considered “The Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping” due to his contributions to the development of accounting as a profession. An Italian mathematician and friend of Leonardo da Vinci, Pacioli published a book on the double-entry system of bookkeeping in 1494.

**6.** By 1880, the modern profession of accounting was fully formed and recognized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. This institute created many of the systems by which accountants practice today. The formation of the institute occurred in large part due to the Industrial Revolution. Merchants not only needed to track their records but sought to avoid bankruptcy as well.

**7.** Accountants may be tasked with recording specific transactions or working with specific sets of information. For this reason, there are several broad groups that most accountants can be grouped into.

**8.** Financial accounting refers to the processes used to generate interim and annual financial statements. The results of all financial transactions that occur during an accounting period are summarized in the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. The financial statements of most companies are audited annually by an external CPA firm.

**9.** Managerial accounting uses much of the same data as financial accounting, but it organizes and utilizes information in different ways. Namely, in managerial accounting, an accountant generates monthly or quarterly reports that a business’s management team can use to make decisions about how the business operates. Managerial accounting also encompasses many other facets of accounting, including budgeting, forecasting, and various financial analysis tools. Essentially, any information that may be useful to management falls underneath this umbrella.

**10.** Just as managerial accounting helps businesses make decisions about management, cost accounting helps businesses make decisions about costing. Essentially, cost accounting considers all of the costs related to producing a product. Analysts, managers, business owners, and accountants use this information to determine what their products should cost. In cost accounting, money is cast as an economic factor in production, whereas in financial accounting, money is considered to be a measure of a company’s economic performance

**11.** While financial accountants often use one set of rules to report the financial position of a company, tax accountants often use a different set of rules. These rules are set at the federal, state, or local level based on what return is being filed. Tax accountants balance compliance with reporting rules while also attempting to minimize a company’s tax liability through thoughtful strategic decision-making. A tax accountant often oversees the entire tax process of a company: the strategic creation of the organization chart, the operations, the compliance, the reporting, and the remittance of tax liability.

**12.** Accounting is a back-office function where employees may not directly interface with customers, product developers, or manufacturing. However, accounting plays a key role in the strategic planning, growth, and compliance requirements of a company.

**13.** Accounting is necessary for company growth. Without insight into how a business is performing, it is impossible for a company to make smart financial decisions through forecasting. Without accounting, a company wouldn’t be able to tell which products are its best sellers, how much profit is made in each department, and what overhead costs are holding back profits.

**14.** Accounting is necessary for funding. External investors want confidence that they know what they are investing in. Prior to private funding, investors will usually require financial statements (often audited) to gauge the overall health of a company. The same rules pertain to debt financing. Banks and other lending institutions will often require financial statements in compliance with accounting rules as part of the underwriting and review process for issuing a loan.

**15.** Accounting is necessary for owner exit. Small companies that may be looking to be acquired often need to present financial statements as part of acquisition or merger efforts. Instead of simply closing a business, a business owner may attempt to “cash-out” of their position and receive compensation for building a company. The basis for valuing a company is to use its accounting records.

**16.** Accounting is necessary to make payments. A company naturally incurs debt, and part of the responsibility of managing that debt is to make payments on time to the appropriate parties. Without positively fostering these business relationships, a company may find itself without a key supplier or vendor. Through accounting, a company can always know who it has debts to and when those debts are coming due.

**17.** Accounting is necessary to collect payments. A company may agree to extend credit to its customers. Instead of collecting cash at the time of an agreement, it may give a customer trade credit terms such as net 30. Without accounting, a company may have a hard time keeping track of who owes it money and when that money is to be received.

**18.** Accounting may be required. Public companies are required to issue periodic financial statements in compliance with GAAP or IFRS. Without these financial statements, a company may be de-listed from an exchange. Without proper tax accounting compliance, a company may receive fines or penalties.

**19.** To illustrate double-entry accounting, imagine a business sends an invoice to one of its clients. An accountant using the double-entry method records a debit to accounts receivables, which flows through to the balance sheet, and a credit to sales revenue, which flows through to the income statement. 

**20.** When the client pays the invoice, the accountant credits accounts receivables and debits cash.Double-entry accounting is also called balancing the books, as all of the accounting entries are balanced against each other. If the entries aren’t balanced, the accountant knows there must be a mistake somewhere in the general ledger.

**21.** Accountants help businesses maintain accurate and timely records of their finances. Accountants are responsible for maintaining records of a company’s daily transactions and compiling those transactions into financial statements such as the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. Accountants also provide other services, such as performing periodic audits or preparing ad-hoc management reports.

**22.** Accountants hail from a wide variety of backgrounds. Generally speaking, however, attention to detail is a key component in accountancy, since accountants must be able to diagnose and correct subtle errors or discrepancies in a company’s accounts. The ability to think logically is also essential, to help with problem-solving. Mathematical skills are helpful but are less important than in previous generations due to the wide availability of computers and calculators.

**23.** The work performed by accountants is at the heart of modern financial markets. Without accounting, investors would be unable to rely on timely or accurate financial information, and companies’ executives would lack the transparency needed to manage risks or plan projects. Regulators also rely on accountants for critical functions such as providing auditors’ opinions on companies’ annual 10-K filings. In short, although accounting is sometimes overlooked, it is absolutely critical for the smooth functioning of modern finance.

BEIJING—Some Chinese enterprises have suffered from unexpected “breakups” from their western “fiancées” recently, due to some western countries’ unfounded presumption or groundless fear.

In October, the German government announced, due to “security concerns”, to restart the investigation on the sale of the German semi-conductor maker Aixtron to a Chinese company, and to withdraw the clearance certificate it issued in September which confirmed the Chinese buyer’s credibility.

Under the pressure, the buyer, China’s Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund (FGC), announced to withdraw the takeover offer.

It looks as if China’s investment activities abroad have frequently prompted fear in western media and among politicians, and the reason they have often cited against China-proposed business deals is “national security”.

“Arguments about national security are invariably protectionism with some fancy PR,” British business columnist Matthew Lynn commented on an almost customary use of “security concern” by developed economies to block the Chinese investment.

According to Lynn, as China’s economy expands, it is inevitable that its corporate powers would start to reach out to the world, just like what the Republic of Korea did 20 years ago, the Japanese 30 years ago.

Aside from citing hardly warranted security concerns, another trick those biased politicians often use to thwart incoming Chinese investment is to exaggerate the size of China’s investment.

They seek to create a false impression that the Chinese investment has inundated their national economy or even the whole world.

For that, Chinese Ambassador to Germany Shi Mingde published a signed article in the prestigious newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, clarifying that there are currently about 8,200 German companies operating in China, as opposed to 2,000 Chinese companies in Germany, and China’s investment in Germany is only 10 percent of Germany’s investment in China, and accounts for merely 0.2 percent of the total foreign investment in Germany.

Many observers have noted that some countries are showing baseless concern over the Chinese capital and seeing China’s normal business investment as a “Trojan Horse”.

Hannes Deykes, an expert with the European Institute for Asian Studies, said the recent wave of European countries’ worry over the Chinese investment coincides with a protectionist trend and a surge in populism on the continent.

Facing various versions of “China threat”, how should Chinese investors respond?

“The best way is to invest in foreign business in an honest and sincere manner,” said Huo Jianguo, former head of a trade policy body under China’s Commerce Ministry.

Only by showing their sincerity by investing and doing business overseas professionally, can Chinese investors erase their foreign counterparts’ unfounded suspicion and fear, and secure a win-win outcome for both parties, he explained.

Riding a train from London, it will only take 20 minutes to arrive in Reading, where China’s telecom equipment company Huawei’s headquarters are located.

Since 2015, Huawei Britain has literally become a big employer for locals—it owns 1,100 full-time employees, 70 percent of which are hired locally.

According to reports of the Oxford Institute for Economic Research, from 2012 to 2014, Huawei had contributed 1.2 billion US dollars to Britain’s economy.
By 2014, Huawei had increased 7,300 new positions in Britain, and purchased products and service in Britain’s 15 regions.
That explains why the always-critical British media has been saying very few bad words about Huawei.
Some British councilmen have presented Huawei as an example to prove that foreign investment can indeed bring real benefits to Britain.

The city of Dayton in America’s Ohio State is at the rustbelt of the country’s traditional manufacturing industry.
After the financial crisis in 2008, General Motors’ Dayton factory closed down, leaving about 1,000 workers unemployed.
However, in October, the factory reopened and what’s more, became the world’s largest automotive glass facility, with more than 2,000 people working there.
Behind the change is China’s investor Fuyao Group.
Ohio Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor said: “This is a win for Ohio and the community, and most importantly the families that will be impacted by these new jobs.”

In 2012, China’s Sany Heavy Industry Co. Ltd acquired its long time competitor, Germany’s prominent Putzmeister Group.
At first some of its German employees protested in fear of losing their jobs.
However, after four years, the company’s employment in Germany has been steady as ever, and the brand intact, relationship with suppliers unchanged, and revenue increasing 30 percent.
Germans found out that the new parent enterprise didn’t take away Putzmeister’s vaunted technology and move its production back to China as they once feared.
On the contrary, Sany tried its best to keep the German crew intact and divide markets by selling its own pumps in China and Putzmeister pumps in the rest of the world.
The German firm acts as the global distribution hub for the combined company.
“I think if it were an American company, it would be a lot worse for the workforce,” said Joerg Loeffler, head of the workers’ union at Putzmeister.

There are many other similar cases.
More and more people are now realizing that Chinese enterprises’ investment is not a monster as rumored, but eyes in the long run and seeks win-win results by cooperation and merger.

In 2002, one year after China joined the World Trade Organization, China’s direct overseas investment was $2.7 billion.
In 2015, that figure surged to $145.67 billion, nearly 54 times more than the 2002 figure, with an annual increase of 33.6 percent.
It was also in 2015 that China for the first time became a capital export country.
Its annual direct foreign investment volume accounted for 9.9 percent of the total global investment, ranking the second in the world.

In the first three quarters 2016, Chinese companies have implemented 521 overseas mergers and acquisitions, involving 18 industries in 67 countries and regions, and real trade volume of $67.44 billion.

According to HSBC chief China economist Qu Hongbin, besides in quantity, the quality of the Chinese foreign investment is also improving.
From the initial investment in foreign natural resources such as oil and iron ore, to infrastructure and manufacture, to service, high-tech and culture industries, China’s foreign investment has been upgrading itself by years.

Many experts also pointed out that, Belt and Road Initiative will become the core impetus for the next round of China’s foreign investment.
Along with the function of financial institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Silk Road Fund, the Chinese capital will be more frequently seen in Belt and Road countries and regions.

The Chinese capital’s overseas journey has just begun.
More and more people will feel the Chinese enterprises’ confidence, amity, cooperation and open mind during the process.
Along with the capital, the Chinese economy will also continue its globalization journey, and help to bring prosperity to China and the rest of the world.
