### Section A — Dialogue (Paraphrased, speaker format kept)

**Marni:** Hi. My name is Marni Olivia Olsen. I’m a senior at Ridgefield High. What was it like to be a high school student back in 2002? Well, to begin with, my initials sounded like “Moo.”

**Girls:** Moo!

**Marni:** High school can be tough. Some people rise above it with a bit of luck, but I didn’t have much luck—none at all—starting from my freshman year.

**Student 1:** Sorry, saved.

**Student 2:** Sorry, saved.

**Marni:** I grew up in a small town in Northern California, and my school was just as small…

**Student 3:** Oh—sorry. Saved.

**Marni:** There’s always someone in school who outshines everyone else. In my class, that person was me.

**Student 4:** Shh!

**Squad Leader:** Okay, ladies, let’s do this. Here we go. Five, six, seven, eight… one, cross two, three, four… kick! Keep going. Good luck, girls—big smiles!

**Marni:** I once read that who you are in high school determines who you’ll become for the rest of your life. I truly hope that isn’t true, because things didn’t go my way back then. My big brother Will, though, was amazing at everything.

**Squad Leader:** Let’s go, Gators!

**Squad:** Go, go, Gators!

**Girl:** Nice job, Gator. By the way, you looked prettier with the mask on.

**Marni:** Are you talking to me?

**Will:** Not right now, Marni.

**Marni:** I just want to say I’m really sorry. And those girls are right—I’m a loser.

**Will:** Wait—who said that? Which girls?

**Marni:** What? No… nobody.

**Will:** No. Tell me who called you that. I’ll talk to them.

**Marni:** It doesn’t matter. You can’t always shield me. They’re right.

**Will:** I wish you could see how great you are. You just have to believe in yourself. Once you do, you’ll be able to do anything.

**Marni:** And that’s why Will was always right. When I changed how I saw myself, my past stopped controlling me. I got rid of the braces, wore contacts, even spent more than I should on a haircut. I’ve come a long way since those awful days. If it hadn’t been for the determination of that little girl from Ridgefield, the person you see today wouldn’t be here—working at a top PR firm in Los Angeles, telling junior publicists about the days when I was a poster child for the geek squad. You can’t control what happens to you, but you can control how you respond. It’s all about perception. That’s what public relations is. Thank you—and good luck.

### 中文翻译

**Marni：** 你好，我叫玛妮·奥利维娅·奥尔森。我是里奇菲尔德高中的高四学生。2002 年当高中生是什么感觉？先说个开头，我名字缩写听起来像“哞”。
**女生们：** 哞！
**Marni：** 高中挺难熬的。有的人靠点运气就能挺过去，但我几乎没什么运气，从高一就开始不顺。
**学生1/2：** 抱歉，已保存。（像在取笑/打断的口吻）
**Marni：** 我来自北加州的小镇，学校也很小……
**学生3：** 哦，抱歉，已保存。
**Marni：** 学校里总有一个人特别耀眼，盖过所有人。在我们班，那个人就是我。
**学生4：** 嘘！
**啦啦队长：** 女生们准备，上！五六七八……交叉、踢腿……继续，笑起来！
**Marni：** 我读过一句话：高中时的你会决定你一辈子是谁。我真希望不是这样，因为那段日子对我很不友好。不过我哥哥威尔不一样，他什么都很厉害。
**啦啦队/队员：** 加油，鳄鱼队！
**女生：** 干得漂亮。顺便说一句，你戴着面罩更好看。
**Marni：** 你是在说我吗？
**Will：** 现在不行，玛妮。
**Marni：** 我只是想说对不起。那些女生说得对……我很失败。
**Will：** 谁说的？哪些人？
**Marni：** 没……没人。
**Will：** 不，告诉我是谁。我去跟她们说。
**Marni：** 没意义。你不可能永远保护我。她们说得对。
**Will：** 我真希望你能看到你有多好。你要相信自己，一旦相信，你什么都能做到。
**Marni：** 所以威尔总是对的。我改变了看待自己的方式，过去就不再定义我。我摘牙套、戴隐形、甚至为发型花了不少钱。我从那段糟糕日子里走出来了。也正是因为那个里奇菲尔德的小女孩够坚定，今天站在你们面前的我才会存在——在洛杉矶顶尖公关公司工作，给新人讲我当年“书呆子代表”的日子。你无法控制发生在你身上的事，但你能控制你的反应。一切都关乎“别人怎么看”。这就是公关。谢谢大家，祝好运。

## Section B — “Why I Chose Yale”

## 

Students at Yale come from all over the world, bringing with them every imaginable interest. Do our different passions separate us? Not at all. Our residential colleges give us a shared sense of family and belonging. For all four years, we live together with pride in our colleges. With so many excellent facilities to help you grow, you’ll hardly ever want to leave campus.

Every college has a dining hall with salad bars, grills, and organic choices at every meal. I basically live on those meals. Each college also has a common room—essential for studying, meeting in groups, or just hanging out.

When the dining halls close, there are butteries where you can grab snacks. And if you need a break from studying, there are game rooms where you can relax.

I can walk into the college library without even stepping outside. Just down the hall, my laundry gets washed and dried. Two floors below, I work out in the college gym. Then I meet my friends for rehearsal in the dance studio.

There are countless music practice rooms where I can improve my skills. We even have a movie theater. Honestly, that place gives me chills.

Yale doesn’t have traditional dormitories. Instead, we live in suites, so you might have a roommate or several suite-mates. We even have matching sheets. Outside, there’s a shared common area—come in, sit for a while. There’s space for couches, TVs, and even a lava lamp if that’s your style.

At the center of every college are the master and the dean. They live with us and eat with us, and they support us in everything—from academics to daily life.
“Am I taking the right class?”
“Will these credits count?”
“I’m sick—can I get a pass?”
“What’s a good summer program?”
They always have advice.

The master brings everyone together, acting as a senior professor—hosting study breaks, lectures, and special events when we need time off. If there’s a Broadway show, I’ll happily organize a trip. We can host concerts, proudly sing together, and share free food in the evenings. Tomorrow, there’s even a master’s tea.

Master’s Tea is a chance to see well-known guests up close, hear their stories, and ask them questions.

Residential colleges bring us together. They give us a place to cheer, a place to call home for all four years. A strong sense of unity, deep community, and lasting friendships grow here.
That’s why I chose Yale.

耶鲁的学生来自世界各地，拥有各种各样的兴趣与热情。我们的不同会让我们彼此分离吗？不会。住宿学院制度让我们拥有共同的家庭感和归属感。四年里，我们都以自己的学院为荣地生活在一起。这里有如此完善的设施来支持你的成长，你几乎不会想离开校园。

每个学院都有食堂，提供沙拉吧、烧烤以及每餐的有机食品。我几乎每天都在那儿吃饭。每个学院还有公共休息室——无论是学习、小组讨论，还是单纯放松，都离不开它。

当食堂关闭后，还有小卖部可以吃点夜宵。如果你学习累了，还可以去游戏室放松一下。

我不用出门就能到学院图书馆。走廊尽头就是洗衣房，我的衣服可以直接洗好烘干。往下两层是健身房，我经常去锻炼。之后我会去舞蹈室和朋友一起排练。

校园里有大量音乐练习室，让我不断提升技能。我们甚至还有自己的电影院——真的让人激动不已。

耶鲁没有传统意义上的宿舍，而是以套间形式居住。你可能有一个或多个室友。我们甚至连床单都是统一配套的。走到外面，还有公共活动区，欢迎你进来坐坐。沙发、电视，甚至熔岩灯，全看你的风格。

每个学院的核心是学院院长和教务长。他们和我们一起生活、一起吃饭，支持我们的学习和生活。
“我这门课选得对吗？”
“这些学分算数吗？”
“我生病了，能请假吗？”
“有什么好的暑期项目？”
他们总能给出建议。

学院院长像一位资深教授，把大家凝聚在一起。他们会在我们需要休息时组织学习间歇、讲座和各种活动。如果有百老汇演出，我会很乐意组织大家一起去看。我们还能举办音乐会，一起合唱，晚上还有免费食物可以分享。甚至明天还有院长茶会。

“院长茶会”是一个近距离接触名人、聆听他们故事并向他们提问的机会。

住宿学院让我们团结在一起，给我们一个可以欢呼、可以称之为“家”的地方，整整四年。在这里，团结感、社区感和友谊不断成长。
这就是我选择耶鲁的原因。

**Logue:**
Well, that shows your speech difficulty isn’t something permanent. What do you think caused it?

**King:**
I… I don’t know. I really don’t. I don’t even care anymore. I just stutter. No one can change that.

**Logue:**
I’m willing to bet that you can read smoothly—right here, right now. If I win, I get to ask you more questions.

**King:**
And if I win?

**Logue:**
Then you don’t have to answer them.

**King:**
A wager usually involves money.

**Logue:**
Let’s keep it simple. Just a shilling.

**King:**
I don’t carry any cash.

**Logue:**
I had a feeling you wouldn’t. I’ll cover it—you can pay me back next time.

**King:**
If there is a next time.

**Logue:**
We haven’t agreed on that yet. Please stand up and take a look at the text over there.

**King:**
I… I can’t read this.

**Logue:**
Then you owe me a shilling for not even trying.

**King:**
To… to be, or not to be—that is… damn it! I still can’t read it.

**Logue:**
Hold on—I’m not finished yet. I’m recording your voice and will play it back to you on the same machine.

This is a remarkable device, the newest invention from America—a Silvertone. Put these on. There’s a rhythm in it, my friend. You could even make money with this.

*[Classical music begins playing]*

**King:**
You’re playing music!

**Logue:**
Exactly.

**King:**
Then how can I hear myself speak?

**Logue:**
Well, your brain certainly knows what your mouth is doing, doesn’t it?

**King:**
You’re not exactly familiar with royal princes, are you?

**Logue:**
Hopeless, utterly hopeless!

**King:**
You’re being absurd. Would you really lie to a prince just to win twelve pennies?

**Logue:**
I have no idea what an Australian might do for that amount.

**King:**
Play it back.

**Logue:**
No.

**King:**
Please.

**Logue:**
All right then. Since I won, I get to ask the questions.

**King:**
Thank you, Doctor. I… I don’t think this is going to work for me.

# Unit 2 · Section B

**Win with Words**
*(Paraphrased English Version)*

------

## Section B — English (Paraphrased)

This passage is adapted from a well-known American radio program called *Think a Minute*, hosted by Jhan and Iris Tiafau Hurst.

A famous saying goes that words are the strongest force humans possess. Words are like nitroglycerin: they can destroy bridges, but they can also heal wounded hearts. Everything depends on how they are used—whether as weapons to cause harm or as tools to help and heal. Our words truly carry the power of life and death. Throughout history, words have sparked wars and brought peace, ended lives and saved them. They can build or ruin a person’s reputation and career. That is why one of the most important keys to success is learning how to use words wisely—saying the right thing, at the right moment, and in the right way.

At times, silence can be the strongest message of all. It is often difficult to argue against silence. Those who truly have something meaningful to say often speak very little. A wise and successful person can communicate much more by speaking less. Remember the saying: “You’ll almost never regret holding your tongue, but you will often regret speaking too much.” Sometimes, you have to let others speak until they reveal their true intentions—like a fish getting caught the moment it opens its mouth. A good principle to live by is this: never speak unless your words are better than silence.

What you say about others often reveals more about you than about them. This happens because we all have flaws, and we sometimes take pleasure in pointing out the faults of others to make ourselves feel superior. You may believe that what you think and say is what you truly are, but remember—good words can be spoken just as easily as bad ones. If we are truly wise, we will keep our words gentle and positive, because one day we may be forced to swallow them. Soft words may seem light, but they carry tremendous weight.

The sooner we learn to use language to encourage and uplift others rather than to tear them down, the sooner we will find success and enjoy healthier, happier relationships. However, before changing our words, we must first change our hearts, because words are born there.

Take a moment to think.

**用语言赢得成功**

本文改编自美国一档知名广播节目《Think a Minute》，由 Jhan 和 Iris Tiafau Hurst 主持。

有句名言说，语言是人类所拥有的最强大力量。语言就像硝化甘油：既能炸毁桥梁，也能治愈人心。一切取决于你如何使用它——是作为伤害他人的武器，还是作为帮助和治愈的工具。语言真正掌握着生与死的力量。纵观历史，语言既引发过战争，也促成过和平；既终结过生命，也拯救过生命。语言可以成就一个人的名声与事业，也可以将其彻底毁掉。因此，成功最重要的关键之一，就是学会正确地使用语言——在合适的时间、用合适的方式，说合适的话。

有时候，沉默反而是最有力的表达。沉默往往让人无从反驳。真正有智慧、有分量的人，往往话并不多。一个聪明而成功的人，用更少的话却能表达更多。请记住一句话：“你几乎不会因为没说出口而后悔，却常常会为说得太多而懊悔。”有时，你需要让别人多说，直到他们暴露真实想法——就像鱼张开嘴的一刻，也正是被捕的一刻。一个值得遵循的原则是：如果你的话不能胜过沉默，那就保持沉默。

你对别人的评价，往往更多地反映了你自己，而不是别人。这是因为我们每个人都有缺点，而有时我们会通过议论他人的不足，把他们拉低到与自己同一水平。你可能以为“你所看到、所说的，就是你自己”，但请记住，说好话和说坏话同样容易。如果我们真的有智慧，就会让自己的语言温和而甜美，因为终有一天，我们可能不得不吞下自己说过的话。温柔的语言看似轻微，却蕴含着巨大的力量。

我们越早学会用语言去鼓励和成就他人，而不是贬低和伤害他人，就越早能够获得成功，并享受更健康、更幸福的人际关系。但在改变语言之前，我们必须先改变内心，因为语言正是从内心诞生的。

请花一分钟，认真想一想。

**B:** I’m gonna go work out. I’m gonna get in shape. Drop a few pounds.

**A:** Yeah? How you gonna do that?

**B:** Well, uh… first, I figure I would run 20 kilometers. Second, I’d do about 500 push-ups.

**A:** OK!

**B:** And third, I’d do about 1,000 sit-ups. That should really help me drop some pounds. Get into shape. Slim down.

**A:** Wow! How much do you want to lose?

**B:** I want to lose a lot of weight. 100 pounds.

**A:** What? That’s too much. You gonna end up in the hospital.

**B:** Whatever! I’m committed.

**A:** Do you even know what you’re doing? You need a trainer.

**B:** OK, fine! You are my trainer. What do I need to do?

**A:** Well, there are several ways to lose weight. The best way is to start slow. Do a few workouts and then gradually progress. Maybe hit the gym and get a good pair of running shoes.

**B:** OK, but I don’t have a lot of time to do this.

**A:** Too many people think you can get in good shape overnight. And it just doesn’t work like that for some. For some it’s easier than others.

**Turn off Your Phone and Discover
All Human around Us**

*Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google, speaks to students at the graduation ceremony in University of Pennsylvania in 2009.*

------

## English Text (Complete & Verbatim)

Graduation gives you the courage to be unreasonable. Don’t bother to have a plan. Instead let’s have some luck. Success is really about being ready for the good opportunities that come before you. It’s not to have a detailed plan about everything you’re going to do, you can’t plan innovation or inspiration, but you can be ready for it. And when you see it, you can jump on it and you can make a difference, as many of the people here today have already done.

The important point here is that, if you forego your plan you also then have to forego fear. In many ways in the last four years and maybe in high school as well, you’ve been penalized (处罚) for making mistakes. From now on, the rewards will gravitate (吸引) to those who make mistakes and learn from them, as the president said.

So stop right now. Take a minute and think of something completely new and work on that. Take that as your challenge; take that as your opportunity.

So how should you do it, how should you behave? Well, do it in a group. It’s much more fun anyway. None of us is as smart as all of us. Universities now are good at teaching you how to work with other people, it’s no longer the lone light sitting in the lab; it’s a team.

And you can see Twitter as an example of a form of social intelligence; use it. Find a network of people who care about you and so forth and so on. You can imagine watching Watson and Crick, who discovered the structure of DNA, did it at a university.

You can imagine today, there are two people who probably met on Facebook at a university. And then are going to say to each other, “What are you up to right now?” “Oh, I’m finding the secret of life, then I’m off to a hub. LOL.” You know. It’s okay. Do it together.

But amidst all of this, some truths emerge. Leadership and personality matter a lot. Intelligence, education, and analytical reasoning matter. Trust matters. In the network world, trust is the most important currency (信任是金钱).

Which brings me to my final question. What is, in fact, the meaning of life? And in a world where everything is remembered and everything is kept forever — the

**关掉你的手机，去发现你身边真实的人**

*谷歌董事长埃里克·施密特在 2009 年宾夕法尼亚大学毕业典礼上的演讲*

毕业会给你一种“不讲理”的勇气。不要急着制定人生计划。相反，给自己一点运气。成功的关键，其实在于你是否已经准备好迎接出现在你面前的好机会。人生并不是要为你将要做的每一件事都制定一个详尽的计划，因为你无法计划创新或灵感，但你可以为它们的到来做好准备。当你看见机会时，你就能抓住它，产生影响——正如今天在座的许多人已经做到的那样。

这里最重要的一点是：如果你放弃了计划，你也必须放弃恐惧。在过去四年里，甚至在高中阶段，你们常常因为犯错而受到惩罚。但从现在开始，正如校长所说，回报将会流向那些敢于犯错、并从错误中学习的人。

所以，现在就停下来。花一分钟，去想一件全新的事情，然后去做。把它当成你的挑战，把它当成你的机会。

那么你该如何去做？你该如何表现？答案是：和别人一起做。这样也更有趣。没有任何一个人能比所有人加在一起更聪明。如今的大学已经很擅长教你如何与他人合作，科学研究不再是实验室里孤零零的一盏灯，而是一支团队。

你也可以把 Twitter 看作是一种社会智能的体现，并善加利用。建立一个关心你的人际网络，等等。你可以想象沃森和克里克发现 DNA 结构的过程——那也是在大学完成的。

你还可以想象，在今天，有两个人可能在大学里通过 Facebook 相识。然后他们会对彼此说：“你现在在干嘛？”“哦，我正在寻找生命的奥秘，然后要去一个创业中心。哈哈。”你明白的。这没什么不好。一起去做。

但在这一切之中，有一些真理逐渐显现出来。领导力和人格非常重要。智力、教育和分析能力也很重要。信任同样重要。在网络世界里，信任是最重要的货币。

这也引出了我最后一个问题：究竟，什么才是生命的意义？在一个一切都会被记住、一切都会被永久保存的世界里——

**JANE:**
You are to be married.

**ROCHESTER:**
I see Mrs. Fairfax has intimated my intention to put my neck into the sacred noose.

**JANE:**
Adele should go to school and I must seek another situation.

**ROCHESTER:**
Congratulations, sir.

**JANE:**
Thornfield is a pleasant place in spring, isn’t it?

**ROCHESTER:**
Yes, sir.

**JANE:**
You will be sorry to part with it. It’s always the way with events in life. No sooner have you got settled, then a voice cries, “Rise and move on!” I’ll find you a new situation, Jane. One I hope you’ll accept.

**ROCHESTER:**
I shall be ready when your order to march comes.

**JANE:**
Must I really lose a faithful paid subordinate such as yourself?

**ROCHESTER:**
You must.

**JANE:**
We’ve been good friends, haven’t we?

**ROCHESTER:**
Yes, sir.

**JANE:**
I’ve a strange feeling with regard to you, as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly knotted to a similar string in you. And if you were to leave, I’m afraid that cord of community would snap. And I’ve a notion that I’d take to bleeding inwardly. As for you, you’d forget me.

**ROCHESTER:**
How? I have lived a full life here. I have not been trampled on. I have not been petrified. I have not been excluded from every glimpse of what is bright. I have known you, Mr. Rochester, and it strikes me with anguish to be torn from you.

**JANE:**
Then why must you leave?

**ROCHESTER:**
Because of your wife.

**JANE:**
I have no wife.

**ROCHESTER:**
But you are to be married.

**JANE:**
Jane, you must stay.

**ROCHESTER:**
And become nothing to you? Am I a machine without feelings? Do you think that because I am poor, obscure, plain and little that I am soulless and heartless? I have as much soul as you — and full as much heart. And if God had blessed me with beauty and wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you.

**JANE:**
I’m not speaking to you through mortal flesh. It is my spirit that addresses your spirit, as if we had passed through the grave and stood at God’s feet, equal — as we are.

**ROCHESTER:**
As we are.

**JANE:**
I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you.

**ROCHESTER:**
Then let your will decide your destiny. I offer you my hand, my heart, Jane. I ask you to pass through life at my side. You are my equal and my likeness. Will you marry me?

**JANE:**
Are you mocking me?

**ROCHESTER:**
Do you doubt me?

**JANE:**
Entirely! Your bride is Miss Ingram.

**ROCHESTER:**
Miss Ingram? She is the machine without feelings. It’s you. You are rare, unearthly thing. Poor and obscure as you are, please accept me as your husband. I must have you for my own.

**JANE:**
You wish me to be your wife?

**ROCHESTER:**
I swear it.

**JANE:**
You love me?

**ROCHESTER:**
I do.

**JANE:**
Then, sir, I will marry you.

**简·爱：**
你要结婚了。

**罗切斯特：**
看来费尔法克斯太太已经暗示了我即将把脖子伸进神圣的绞索。

**简·爱：**
阿黛勒该去上学了，而我必须另谋职位。

**罗切斯特：**
恭喜你，先生。

**简·爱：**
桑菲尔德春天里是个宜人的地方，不是吗？

**罗切斯特：**
是的，先生。

**简·爱：**
你会舍不得离开的。人生中的事情总是这样——刚刚安顿下来，就有一个声音喊：“起来，继续前行！”我会为你找到一份新的职位，简。我希望你能接受。

**罗切斯特：**
等你下令出发时，我就准备好了。

**简·爱：**
我真的必须失去一位如此忠诚、受薪的下属吗？

**罗切斯特：**
你必须。

**简·爱：**
我们一直是好朋友，不是吗？

**罗切斯特：**
是的，先生。

**简·爱：**
我对你有一种奇怪的感觉，仿佛在我左肋下有一根线，与另一根系在你身上的线紧紧相连。如果你离开，我担心这条联系的纽带会断裂，而我会因此内心流血。至于你，你会忘记我。

**罗切斯特：**
怎么会？我在这里度过了完整的人生。我没有被践踏，没有被石化，也没有被剥夺一切光明。我认识了你，简，这种被迫与你分离的念头让我痛苦不堪。

**简·爱：**
那你为什么一定要离开？

**罗切斯特：**
因为你的妻子。

**简·爱：**
我没有妻子。

**罗切斯特：**
但你要结婚了。

**简·爱：**
简，你必须留下来。

**罗切斯特：**
留下来却变得对你毫无意义吗？难道我是没有感情的机器？你以为因为我贫穷、卑微、相貌平平、身材矮小，我就没有灵魂、没有心吗？我和你一样有灵魂，也同样有一颗完整的心。如果上帝赐予我美貌与财富，我会让你像我现在一样难以离开。

**简·爱：**
我不是用凡俗之躯在与你说话，而是用我的灵魂在与你的灵魂对话，仿佛我们已穿越坟墓，站在上帝面前，彼此平等——正如我们本来就是。

**罗切斯特：**
正如我们本来就是。

**简·爱：**
我是一个拥有独立意志的自由人，而现在我行使这意志，决定离开你。

**罗切斯特：**
那就让你的意志决定你的命运吧。我把我的手、我的心献给你，简。我请求你与我携手共度人生。你是我的平等者，我的知己。你愿意嫁给我吗？

**简·爱：**
你是在嘲弄我吗？

**罗切斯特：**
你怀疑我吗？

**简·爱：**
完全怀疑！你的新娘是英格拉姆小姐。

**罗切斯特：**
英格拉姆小姐？她才是没有感情的机器。是你。你是罕见而超凡的存在。即便你贫穷、卑微，也请接受我，做我的妻子。我必须拥有你。

**简·爱：**
你希望我成为你的妻子？

**罗切斯特：**
我发誓。

**简·爱：**
你爱我吗？

**罗切斯特：**
我爱。

**简·爱：**
那么，先生，我愿意嫁给你。

The Fringe Benefits of Failure, and the Importance of Imagination

— Commencement Address at Harvard University on June 5, 2008

by J. K. Rowling

Actually, I have wracked my mind and heart for what I ought to say to you today. I have asked myself what I wish I had known at my own graduation, and what important lessons I have learned in the 21 years that has expired between that day and this.

I have come up with two answers. On this wonderful day when we are gathered together to celebrate your academic success, I have decided to talk to you about the benefits of failure. And as you stand on the threshold of what is sometimes called “real life”, I want to extol the crucial importance of imagination.

These may seem quixotic (空想的) or paradoxical (矛盾的) choices, but bear with me.

Looking back at the 21-year-old that I was at graduation, is a slightly uncomfortable experience for the 42-year-old that she has become. Half my lifetime ago, I was striking an uneasy balance between the ambition I had for myself, and what those closest to me expected of me.

I was convinced that the only thing I wanted to do, ever, was to write novels. However, my parents, both of whom came from impoverished (穷困的) backgrounds and neither of whom had been to college, took the view that my overactive imagination was an amusing personal quirk (怪癖) that could never pay a mortgage, or secure a pension. I know the irony strikes like with the force of a cartoon anvil (铁砧) now, but...

So, they had hoped that I would take a vocational degree; I wanted to study English Literature. A compromise was reached that in retrospect satisfied nobody, and I went up to study Modern Languages. Hardly had my parents' car rounded the corner at the end of the road than I ditched (丢弃) German and scuttled off (急跑) down the Classics corridor.

I cannot remember telling my parents that I was studying Classics; they might well have found out for the first time on graduation day. Of all the subjects on this planet, I think they would have been hard put to name one less useful than Greek mythology when it came to securing the keys to an executive bathroom.

Now I would like to make it clear, in parenthesis, that I do not blame my parents for their point of view. There is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction; the moment you are old enough to take the wheel, responsibility lies with you. What is more, I cannot criticise my parents for hoping that I would never experience poverty. They had been poor themselves, and I have since been poor, and I quite agree with them that it is not an ennobling experience. Poverty entails fear, and stress, and sometimes depression; it means a thousand petty humiliations and hardships. Climbing out of poverty by your own efforts, that is something on which to pride yourself, but poverty itself is romanticised only by fools.

What I feared most for myself at your age was not poverty, but failure. At your age, in spite of a distinct lack of motivation at university, where I had spent far too long in the coffee bar writing stories, and far too little time at lectures, I had a knack for passing examinations, and that, for years, had been the measure of success in my life and that of my peers.

Now I am not dull enough to suppose that because you are young, gifted and well-educated, you have never known heartbreak or hardship. Talent and intelligence never yet inoculated anyone against the caprice of the Fates, and I do not for a moment suppose that everyone here has enjoyed an existence of unruffled privilege and contentment.

However, the fact that you are graduating from Harvard suggests that you are not very well-acquainted with failure. You might be driven by a fear of failure quite as much as a desire for success. Indeed, your conception of failure might not be too far from the average person's idea of success, so high have you already flown.

Ultimately, we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it. So I think it fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded, and I was jobless, a lone parent, and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless. The fears that my parents had for me, and that I had for myself, had both come to pass, and by every usual standard, I was the biggest failure I knew.

Now, I am not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun. That period of my life was a dark one, and I had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairy tale resolution. I had no idea then how far the tunnel extended, and for a long time, any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality.

So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had already been realised, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.

You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case, you fail by default.

Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations. Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way. I discovered that I had a strong will, and more discipline than I had suspected; I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies.

The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity. Such knowledge is a true gift, for all that it is painfully won, and it has been worth more to me than any qualification I ever earned.

So, given a Time Turner, I would tell my 21-year-old self that personal happiness lies in knowing that life is not a check-list of acquisition or achievement. Your qualifications, your CV, are not your life, though you will meet many people of my age and older who confuse the two. Life is difficult, and complicated, and beyond anyone's total control, and the humility to know that will enable you to survive its vicissitudes (盛衰).

《失败的额外收益以及想象力的重要性》

——2008年6月5日在哈佛大学毕业典礼上的演讲

作者：J. K. 罗琳

事实上，为了今天该对你们说些什么，我绞尽脑汁、搜肠刮肚。我问自己，在我的毕业典礼上，我希望自己当时知道些什么，以及在毕业后的21年里，我学到了哪些重要的教训。

我得出了两个答案。在这个我们齐聚一堂庆祝你们学业成功的伟大日子里，我决定和你们谈谈失败的益处。当你们站在所谓的“现实生活”的门槛上时，我想颂扬想象力的至关重要性。

这些选择可能看起来有些异想天开或自相矛盾，但请听我道来。

回首21岁毕业时的那个我，对于已经成为42岁的她（现在的我）来说，是一段略微令人不安的经历。半辈子以前，我一直在自己的抱负和身边亲近的人对我的期望之间寻找一种不安的平衡。

我曾坚信，我唯一想做的事就是写小说。然而，我的父母都出身于贫困背景，且都没有上过大学。他们认为我过于活跃的想象力是一种有趣的个人怪癖，永远无法支付抵押贷款或保障养老金。我知道现在的讽刺意味就像动画片里的铁砧一样沉重，但是……

所以，他们曾希望我修读职业学位；而我想学英国文学。最终达成了一个回顾起来谁都不满意的折衷方案，我去学习了现代语言。但我父母的车刚在路尽头的拐角处转弯，我就丢弃了德语，溜进了古典学走廊。

我不记得告诉过父母我在学古典学；他们很可能是在毕业典礼那天第一次发现。在地球上的所有学科中，我认为他们很难说出有什么比希腊神话在获得高管专用卫生间钥匙方面更没用的了。

现在我想明确声明（括号里的话），我不怪我的父母。责怪父母把你引向错误的方向是有有效期的；一旦你到了足够大能自己掌握方向盘的年纪，责任就在你自己身上。此外，我不能批评我的父母希望我永远不要经历贫穷。他们自己也曾贫穷过，后来我也经历过贫穷，我非常同意他们的观点，即贫穷并不是一种让人变得高尚的经历。贫穷意味着恐惧、压力，有时甚至是抑郁；它意味着成千上万琐碎的屈辱和艰辛。靠自己的努力摆脱贫困，那是值得自豪的事情，但只有傻瓜才会把贫穷本身浪漫化。

在你这个年纪，我最担心的不是贫穷，而是失败。在你这个年纪，尽管我在大学里明显缺乏动力——我在咖啡馆写故事的时间太长，而在听课的时间太短——但我有一种通过考试的诀窍，多年来，这一直是我和同龄人衡量成功的标准。

现在我还不至于笨到以为你们年轻、有才华、受过良好的教育，就从未经历过心碎或艰辛。才华和智慧从未让任何人对命运的反复无常免疫，我一刻也不认为这里的每一个人都过着一帆风顺、充满特权与满足的生活。

然而，你们从哈佛大学毕业这一事实表明，你们对失败并不十分熟悉。你们可能受对失败的恐惧驱动，程度不亚于对成功的渴望。事实上，由于你们已经飞得这么高，你们对失败的概念可能与普通人对成功的理解相差不远。

最终，我们都必须自己决定什么是失败，但如果你允许的话，世界非常渴望给你一套标准。所以我认为公平地说，按照任何常规标准，在毕业仅仅七年后，我就遭到了史诗级的失败。一段极其短暂的婚姻破裂了，我失业了，成了一个单亲母亲，而且在现代英国，我穷到了在不流离失所的前提下所能达到的最穷境地。我父母对我的担忧，以及我对自己担心的，都成了现实。按所有通常的标准来看，我是我认识的人中最失败的一个。

现在，我不打算站在这里告诉你们失败很有趣。我生命中的那段时期很黑暗，我也完全不知道后来媒体所描述的那种童话般的结局会出现。我当时不知道隧道到底有多长，而且在很长一段时间里，隧道尽头的任何光亮都只是希望，而非现实。

那么，我为什么要谈论失败的好处呢？简单来说，因为失败意味着剥离掉那些不重要的东西。我不再自欺欺人地认为自己是除了真实自我之外的其他任何人，并开始把我所有的精力都投入到完成对我来说唯一重要的工作中。如果我真的在其他任何事情上取得了成功，我也许永远找不到在我认为自己真正所属的领域取得成功的决心。我被释放了，因为我最大的恐惧已经实现了，而我依然活着，我还有一个深爱的女儿，我还有一台旧打字机和一个伟大的构思。于是，人生谷底成了我重建生活的坚实基础。

你们可能永远不会经历我那样规模的失败，但人生中某些失败是不可避免的。生活而不遭遇失败是不可能的，除非你活得如此谨慎，以至于你根本没有活过——在这种情况下，你默认就失败了。

失败给了我一种从未通过考试获得过的内在安全感。失败教会了我一些关于自己的事情，这些事情我无法通过其他方式学到。我发现我有坚强的意志，以及比我预想的更多的自律；我还发现我拥有价值真正高于红宝石的朋友。

意识到自己能从挫折中变得更睿智、更强大，意味着你从此对自己的生存能力有了保障。除非你经历过逆境的考验，否则你永远不会真正了解自己，也不会真正了解你的人际关系的强度。这样的知识是一份真正的礼物，尽管它是通过痛苦获得的，但对我来说，它比我获得的任何文凭都有价值。

所以，如果有时间转换器，我会告诉21岁的自己：个人幸福在于认识到生活并不是一张获取或成就的清单。你的资历、你的履历，这些都不是你的生活，尽管你会遇到许多像我一样或更年长的人混淆这两者。生活是困难的，复杂的，超出了任何人的完全控制，而意识到这一点的谦卑将使你能够度过人生的盛衰。

**Mulan:** Huh, I can explain.
**Chi Fu:** Huh? So it’s true.
**Mulan:** Shang!
**Chi Fu:** I knew there was something wrong with you. A woman. Treacherous snake.
**Mulan:** My name is Mulan. I did it to save my father.
**Chi Fu:** High treason!
**Mulan:** I didn’t mean for it to go this far.
**Chi Fu:** Ultimate dishonor.
**Mulan:** It was the only way. Please believe me.
**Chi Fu:** Hmph, Captain? Restrain him.
**Yao, Ling and Chien-Po:** Nooooo!
**Chi Fu:** You know the law.
**Shang:** A life for a life. My debt is repaid. Move out!
**Chi Fu:** But you can’t just…
**Shang:** I said, “Move out!”
**Mushu:** I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an entourage. Man, all my fine work, pfft. Hi.
**Mulan:** I should never have left home.
**Mushu:** Eh, come on, you went to save your father’s life. Who knew you’d end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and losing all your friends. You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go.
**Mulan:** Maybe I didn’t go for my father. Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right. So when I looked in the mirror, I’d see someone worthwhile. But I was wrong. I see nothing.
**Mushu:** Well that’s because this just needs a little spit, that’s all. Let me shine this up for ya. I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty. The truth is we’re both frauds. Your ancestors never sent me, they don’t even like me. I mean, you risked your life to help people you love. I risked your life to help myself. At least you had good intentions.

**木须：** 那是因为这只需要一点“抛光”，明白吗？让我来帮你擦亮。看看你，多漂亮啊。其实真相是——我们两个都是骗子。你的祖先根本没派我来，他们甚至不喜欢我。你是为了救你爱的人，拿命去赌；而我，是拿你的命去帮我自己。至少，你的出发点是好的。

## **SectionB**：

【原文】

Now, I want to start with a question: When was the last time you were called childish? For kids like me, being called childish can be a frequent occurrence. Every time we make irrational demands, exhibit irresponsible behavior or display any other signs of being normal American citizens, we are called childish. Which really bothers me. After all, take a look at these events: Imperialism and colonization, world wars, George W. Bush. Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.

Now, what have kids done? Well, Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust, Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States, and, most recently, Charlie Simpson helped to raise 120,000 pounds for Haiti on his little bike. So, as you can see evidenced by such examples, age has absolutely nothing to do with it. The traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age-discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking.

Thank you.

Then again, who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren't exactly what the world needs? Maybe you've had grand plans before but stopped yourself, thinking, "That's impossible," or, "That costs too much," or, "That won't benefit me." For better or worse, we kids aren't hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things. Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking. Like my wish that no one went hungry or that...



...everything were a free kind of utopia. How many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities? Sometimes a knowledge of history an18d the past failures of utopian ideals can be a burden because you know that if everything were free, then the food stocks w19ould become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos. On the other hand, we kids still dream about perfection. And that's a good thing because in order to make20 anything a reality, you have to dream about it first.

In many w26ays, our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility. For instance, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington, my home state — yoohoo Washington! (Applause) — has a program called Kids Design Glass, and kids draw their own ideas for glass art. Now, the resident a27rtist said they got some of their best ideas through the program because kids don't think about the limitatio28ns of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes; they just think of good ideas. Now, when you think of glass, you might think of colorful Chihuly des29igns or maybe Italian vases, but k30ids challenge glass artists to go beyond that into the realm of broken-hearted snakes and bacon boys, who you can see has meat vision. (Laughter)



Now, our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insider's knowledge. Kids already do a lot of learning from adults, and we have a lot to share. I think that adults should start learning from kids. Now, I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd, teachers and students, and I like this analogy: It shouldn't just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students, "Do this, do that." The students should teach their teachers. Learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal. The reality, unfortunately, is a little different, and it has a lot to do with trust, or a lack of it.



Now, if you don't trust someone, you place restrictions on them, right? If I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the 10 percent interest I established on her last loan, I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from34 me until she pays it back. (Laughter) True story, by the way. Now, adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every "d35on't do that, don't do this" in the school handbook to restrictions on school Internet use. As history p36oints out, regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control. And although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitar37ian regimes, kids have no, or very little say in making the rules, when really the attitude should be reciprocal, meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger 38population.



Now, what's even worse than restriction is that adults often underestimate kids abilities. We love challenges, but when expectations are l41ow, trust me, we will sink to them. My own parents had any42thing but low expectations for me and my sister.

Okay, so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that, but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ fighters when lots of other ki71ds were hearing "The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round." Well, we heard that one too, but "Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules. 

I loved to wr76ite from the age of four, and when I was six my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word. Thank you Bill Gates and thank you Ma. I wrote over 300 short77 stories on that little laptop, and I wanted to get published. Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published or saying wait until you're older, my pa78rents wer79e really supportive. Many publishers were not quite so encouraging, one large children's publisher ironically saying that they didn't work with children — children's publisher not working with children? I don't know, you're kind of alienating a large client there. (Laughter) Now, one publisher, Action Publishing, was willing to take that leap and trust me and to listen to what I had to say. They published my first book, "Flying Fingers," — you see it here — and from there on, it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools, keynoting to thousands of educators and finally, today, speaking to you.



I appreciate your attention today, because to show that you truly care, you listen. But there's a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults. Kids grow up and become adults just like you. (Laughter) Or just like you? Really? The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult, but rather better adults than you have been, which may be a little challenging considering your guys' credentials (Laughter). But the way progress happens is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones. It's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore. No matter your position or place in life, it is imperative to create opportuni80ties for children so that we can grow up to blow you away. 



Adults and fellow TEDsters, you need to listen and lear84n from kids and trust us and expect more from us. You must lend an ear today, because we are the leaders of tomorrow, which means we're going to be taking care o85f yo86u when you're old and senile. No, just kidding. No, really, we are going to be the next generation, the ones who will bring this world forward. And in ca87se you don't think that this really has meaning for you, remember that cloning is possible, and that involves going through childhood again, in which88 case you'll want to be heard just like my generati89on. Now, the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas. Kids need opportunitie90s to lead and succeed. Are you read91y to make the match? Because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom.



Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you.

《TED-成年人能从孩子身上学到什么》

现在，我想以一个问题开始：你最后一次被别人说是“幼稚”是什么时候？对于像我这样的孩子来说，被说幼稚是常有的事。每当我们提出不合理的要求、表现出不负责任的行为，或者表现出任何作为普通美国公民的正常迹象时，我们就会被贴上幼稚的标签。这真的让我很困扰。毕竟，看看这些事件：帝国主义和殖民扩张、世界大战、乔治·W·布什。问问你自己，谁该为此负责？是成年人。

那么，孩子们做了什么呢？安妮·弗兰克用她对大屠杀震撼人心的记录感动了数百万人；露比·布里奇斯帮助结束了美国的种族隔离；最近，查理·辛普森骑着他的小单车为海地筹集了12万英镑。所以，正如你从这些例子中看到的，年龄与此完全无关。“幼稚”一词所指向的那些特质在成年人身上也随处可见，因此，当我们要批评那些不负责任和不理智的行为时，应该废除这个带有年龄歧视的词。



谢谢。



再说回来，谁能说某些类型的“不理智思考”不正是这个世界所需要的呢？也许你以前有过宏伟的计划，但却阻止了自己，想着：“那是不可能的，”或者“那太贵了，”或者“那对10我没好处。” 无论好坏，我们孩子在考虑“为什么不去做某事”的理由时，受到的束缚较少。孩子们充满了鼓舞人心的志向和充满希望的想法。比如，我的愿望是没有人会挨饿，或者……

……万物都是一种免费的乌托邦。你们中还有多少人依然这样梦想并相信这种可能性？有时，对历史的了解和过去乌托邦理想的失败可能会成为一种负担，因为你知道，如果一切都是免费的，那么45粮食储备就会枯竭匮乏，从而导致混乱。另一方面，我们孩子依然梦想着完美。这是一件好事，因为要让任何事情成为现实，你必须先敢于梦想。

在很多方面，我们大胆的想象力有助于突破可能性的边界。例如，在我家乡华盛顿州的塔科马玻璃博物馆——呼呼，华盛顿州！（掌声）——有一个名为“孩子设计玻璃”的项目，孩子们画出自己对玻璃艺术的想法。驻馆艺术家说，他们通过这个项目获得了一些最好的创意，因为孩子们不会去考虑把玻璃吹成某些形状有多难的限制；他们只考虑好的创意。现在，当你想到玻璃时，你可能会想到色彩斑斓的奇胡利设计或意大利花瓶，但孩子们挑战玻璃艺术家，让他们超越这些，进入“伤心的蛇”和“培根男孩”的境界，你可以看到后者拥有“肉之视野”。（笑声）

现在，我们固有的智慧不一定非得是专业知识。孩子们已经从成年人身上学到了很多，而我们也有很多可以分享。我认为成年人应该开始向孩子学习。我大部分演讲的对象是教育界人士、老师和学生，我喜欢这个比喻：教室里不应该只有老师站在前面告诉学生“做这个，做那个”。学生应该教导他们的老师。成年人和孩子之间的学习应该是相互的。不幸的是，现实情况略有不同，这与信任或缺乏信任有很大关系。

如果你不信任某人，你就会限制他们，对吧？如果我怀疑我姐姐没能力偿还我在上次贷款中设定的10%利息，我就会拒绝她再从我这里借钱，直到她还清为止。（笑声）顺便说一下，这是真事。现在，成年人对孩子似乎普遍持有某种限制性的态度，从学校手册中每一条“不许做这个，不许做那个”到对学校互联网使用的限制。正如历史所指出的，当政权因担心失去控制而感到恐惧时，就会变得压抑。虽然成年人可能还没达到极权政权的程度，但在制定规则时，孩子们几乎没有发言权，而实际上这种态度应该是相互的，这意味着成年群体应该学习并考虑年轻群体的意愿。



比限制更糟糕的是，成年人经常低估孩子的能力。我们热爱挑战，但当期望值很低时，相信我，我们也会随之堕落。我自己的父母对我及我姐姐的期望可一点都不低。

好吧，他们并没有要求我们成为医生或律师之类的，101但我爸爸确实会给我们读亚里士多德和早期防疫先驱的故事，而当时很多其他孩子还在听《公交车上的轮子转呀转》。好吧，我们也听过那首歌，但《防疫先驱》简直酷毙了。（笑声）

我从四岁起就热爱写作。六岁时，我妈妈给我买了我自己的笔记本电脑，装有微软 Word。谢谢比尔·盖茨，也谢谢妈妈。我在那台小电脑上写了300多个短篇故事，我想出版它们。我的父母并没有嘲笑一个孩子想出书这种“异端邪说”，也没有说等长大点再说，而是非常支持我。很多出版商104并不那么鼓励人，具有讽刺意味的是，一家大型儿童出版商竟然说他们不跟孩子合作——儿童105出版商不跟孩子合作？我不知道，你们这是在疏远一个大客户。（笑声）后来，一家名为 Action Publishing 的出版商愿意放手一搏，信任我并倾听我的想法。他们出版了我的第一本书106《飞翔的手指》——就是你们在这里看到的这本——从那时起，我受邀到数百所学107校演讲，向数千名教育工作者做主题演讲，最后，今天，站在这里向你们演讲。



我很感谢大家今天的关注，因为倾听才说明你们是真的在意。但关于“孩子比大人好得多”这个美好愿景也有一个问题：孩子长大后会变成像你们一样的成年人。（笑声）或者就像你们一样？真的吗？我们的目标不是把孩子变成你们那样的成年人，而是变成比你们更优秀的成年人。考虑到你们的资历，这可能有点挑战（笑声）。但进步之所以发生，是因为新的一代和新的时代不断成长发展，并超越前人。这就是我们不再处于黑暗时代的原因。无论你的地位或处境如何，都必须为孩子创造机会，这样我们长大后才能让你们惊艳。（笑声）



成年人和 TED 的伙伴们，你们需要倾听、向孩子学习、信任我们，并对我们寄予更高的期望。今天你们必须侧耳倾听，因为我们是明天的领袖，这意味着等你们老了、糊涂了，将由我们来照顾你们。不，开个玩笑。说真的，我们将是下一代，是推动这个世界前进的人。万一你觉得这和你没关系，109请记住克隆技术是可能的，那意味着要重新经历童年，到那时你会希望像我这一代人一样被倾听。现在，世界需要给新领袖和新创意提供机会。孩子需要领导和成功的机会。你们准备好促成这一切了吗？因为世界的各种问题不该成为人类家庭的传家宝。



谢谢。（掌声）谢谢。谢谢。

## SectionB-戴安娜王妃逝世十周年纪念文章

**(出自)**

### 英文原文

It Is So Painful When Mum Is Gone

By Prince Henry of Wales on the 10th anniversary of Princess Diana's death

William and I can separate life into two parts. There were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father.

And then there are the 10 years since our mother's death. When she was alive we completely took for granted her unrivalled love of life, laughter, fun and folly. She was our guardian, friend, and protector. She never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated.

She will always be remembered for her amazing public work. But behind the media glare, to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world. We would say that, wouldn't we? But we miss her.

She kissed us last thing at night. Her beaming smile greeted us from school. She laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day. She encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure. She, like our father, was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood.

To lose a parent so suddenly as such a young age — as others have experienced — is indescribably shocking and sad. It was an event which changed our lives forever, as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night.

But what is far more important to us now, and into the future, is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered, as she was: fun-loving, generous, down-to-earth, and entirely genuine.

We both think of her every day. We speak about her and laugh together at all the memories. But put simply, she made us and so many other people happy. May this be the way that she is remembered!

### 中文翻译

《当母亲离去，那是如此痛苦》

——威尔士亲王亨利（哈里王子）写于戴安娜王妃逝世十周年

威廉和我可以将生活分为两个部分。 那几年，我们曾有幸拥有父母陪伴在身边的日子。

随后是母亲去世后的这十年。 当她还在世时，我们完全将她那无与伦比的热爱生活、欢笑、趣味和淘气视为理所当然。 她是我们的监护人、朋友和守护者。 她从未让对我们那坚定不移的爱在言语或行动中缺席。

她将因其卓越的公益事业被人们永远铭记。 但在媒体的闪光灯背后，对于我们这两个深爱她的孩子来说，她简直就是世界上最好的母亲。 我们当然会这么说，不是吗？ 但我们真的很想念她。

她在每晚入睡前亲吻我们。 她那灿烂的笑容在校门口迎接我们。 当分享那天她说过的傻话或做过的傻事时，她会歇斯底里、无法自控地大笑。 当我们感到紧张或不确定时，她会鼓励我们。 她和父亲一样，致力于为我们提供一个稳定而有安全感的童年。

像其他人经历过的那样，在如此幼小的年纪突然失去双亲，其震惊与悲痛是无法用言语形容的。 这是一个永远改变了我们生活的事件，对在那晚失去亲人的每个人来说也一定是这样。

但对现在的我们以及未来而言，远为重要的一点是，我们要按照母亲希望的方式去铭记她，记住她的真实模样：热爱生活、慷慨、务实且完全真诚。

我们每天都会想起她。 我们谈论她，一起为所有的回忆欢笑。 简单来说，她让我们和许多其他人都感到快乐。 愿这就是她被世人铭记的方式！
